# DENORM

[Back to family index](../routines-by-family.md) · [Alphabetical index](../routines-alphabetical.md) · [Coverage](../routine-coverage.md)

## Purpose

Subsidiary to DNSQ and DNSQE

## Description

Given an N-vector X, this function calculates the Euclidean norm of X. The Euclidean norm is computed by accumulating the sum of squares in three different sums. The sums of squares for the small and large components are scaled so that no overflows occur. Non-destructive underflows are permitted. Underflows and overflows do not occur in the computation of the unscaled sum of squares for the intermediate components. The definitions of small, intermediate and large components depend on two constants, RDWARF and RGIANT. The main restrictions on these constants are that RDWARF**2 not underflow and RGIANT**2 not overflow. The constants given here are suitable for every known computer. The function statement is DOUBLE PRECISION FUNCTION DENORM(N,X) where N is a positive integer input variable. X is an input array of length N.
