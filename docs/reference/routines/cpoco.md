# CPOCO

[Family: Dense linear algebra](../families/dense-linear-algebra.md) | [All families](../routines-by-family.md) | [Alphabetical index](../routines-alphabetical.md) | [Coverage](../routine-coverage.md)

## Purpose

Factor a complex Hermitian positive definite matrix and estimate the condition number of the matrix.

## Description

CPOCO factors a complex Hermitian positive definite matrix and estimates the condition of the matrix. If RCOND is not needed, CPOFA is slightly faster. To solve A*X = B , follow CPOCO by CPOSL. To compute INVERSE(A)*C , follow CPOCO by CPOSL. To compute DETERMINANT(A) , follow CPOCO by CPODI. To compute INVERSE(A) , follow CPOCO by CPODI. On Entry A COMPLEX(LDA, N) the Hermitian matrix to be factored. Only the diagonal and upper triangle are used. LDA INTEGER the leading dimension of the array A . N INTEGER the order of the matrix A . On Return A an upper triangular matrix R so that A = CTRANS(R)*R where CTRANS(R) is the conjugate transpose. The strict lower triangle is unaltered. If INFO .NE. 0 , the factorization is not complete. RCOND REAL an estimate of the reciprocal condition of A . For the system A*X = B , relative perturbations in A and B of size EPSILON may cause relative perturbations in X of size EPSILON/RCOND . If RCOND is so small that the logical expression 1.0 + RCOND .EQ. 1.0 is true, then A may be singular to working precision. In particular, RCOND is zero if exact singularity is detected or the estimate underflows. If INFO .NE. 0 , RCOND is unchanged. Z COMPLEX(N) a work vector whose contents are usually unimportant. If A is close to a singular matrix, then Z is an approximate null vector in the sense that NORM(A*Z) = RCOND*NORM(A)*NORM(Z) . If INFO .NE. 0 , Z is unchanged. INFO INTEGER = 0 for normal return. = K signals an error condition. The leading minor of order K is not positive definite.

The table reports compiler/interface facts separately from source-prologue semantics. Unknown intent, aliasing, workspace, leading-dimension, and retention rules remain explicit; parameter names alone are never treated as semantic evidence. Native code does not retain ordinary argument pointers unless a reviewed declaration explicitly says otherwise.

### ABI and safety

Canonical path: `slatec_sys::linear_algebra::dense::complex::cpoco`. Native symbol: `cpoco_`. Feature: `linear-algebra-complex`. Provider status: `selected_provider_verified`. ABI fingerprint: `subroutine:void(mut_complex32_array_rank2,mut_i32,mut_i32,mut_f32,mut_complex32_array_rank1,mut_i32)`. Every pointer must be aligned and valid for the full source-defined readable or writable extent; callers must uphold array dimensions, leading dimensions, workspace formulas, aliasing restrictions, callback lifetimes, and process-global runtime serialization.
