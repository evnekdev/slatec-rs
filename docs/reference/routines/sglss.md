## Purpose

Solve a linear least squares problems by performing a QR factorization of the matrix using Householder transformations. Emphasis is put on detecting possible rank deficiency.

## Description

SGLSS solves both underdetermined and overdetermined LINEAR systems AX = B, where A is an M by N matrix and B is an M by NB matrix of right hand sides. If M.GE.N, the least squares solution is computed by decomposing the matrix A into the product of an orthogonal matrix Q and an upper triangular matrix R (QR factorization). If M.LT.N, the minimal length solution is computed by factoring the matrix A into the product of a lower triangular matrix L and an orthogonal matrix Q (LQ factorization). If the matrix A is determined to be rank deficient, that is the rank of A is less than MIN(M,N), then the minimal length least squares solution is computed. SGLSS assumes full machine precision in the data. If more control over the uncertainty in the data is desired, the codes LLSIA and ULSIA are recommended. SGLSS requires MDA*N + (MDB + 1)*NB + 5*MIN(M,N) dimensioned real space and M+N dimensioned integer space. ****************************************************************** * * * WARNING - All input arrays are changed on exit. * * * ****************************************************************** SUBROUTINE SGLSS(A,MDA,M,N,B,MDB,NB,RNORM,WORK,LW,IWORK,LIW,INFO)
