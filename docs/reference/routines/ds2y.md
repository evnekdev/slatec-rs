## Purpose

SLAP Triad to SLAP Column Format Converter. Routine to convert from the SLAP Triad to SLAP Column format.

## Description

Usage: INTEGER N, NELT, IA(NELT), JA(NELT), ISYM DOUBLE PRECISION A(NELT) CALL DS2Y( N, NELT, IA, JA, A, ISYM ) The Sparse Linear Algebra Package (SLAP) utilizes two matrix data structures: 1) the SLAP Triad format or 2) the SLAP Column format. The user can hand this routine either of the of these data structures. If the SLAP Triad format is give as input then this routine transforms it into SLAP Column format. The way this routine tells which format is given as input is to look at JA(N+1). If JA(N+1) = NELT+1 then we have the SLAP Column format. If that equality does not hold then it is assumed that the IA, JA, A arrays contain the SLAP Triad format. =================== S L A P Triad format =================== This routine requires that the matrix A be stored in the SLAP Triad format. In this format only the non-zeros are stored. They may appear in *ANY* order. The user supplies three arrays of length NELT, where NELT is the number of non-zeros in the matrix: (IA(NELT), JA(NELT), A(NELT)). For each non-zero the user puts the row and column index of that matrix element in the IA and JA arrays. The value of the non-zero matrix element is placed in the corresponding location of the A array. This is an extremely easy data structure to generate. On the other hand it is not too efficient on vector computers for the iterative solution of linear systems. Hence, SLAP changes this input data structure to the SLAP Column format for the iteration (but does not change it back). Here is an example of the SLAP Triad storage format for a 5x5 Matrix. Recall that the entries may appear in any order. 5x5 Matrix SLAP Triad format for 5x5 matrix on left. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 |11 12 0 0 15| A: 51 12 11 33 15 53 55 22 35 44 21 |21 22 0 0 0| IA: 5 1 1 3 1 5 5 2 3 4 2 | 0 0 33 0 35| JA: 1 2 1 3 5 3 5 2 5 4 1 | 0 0 0 44 0| |51 0 53 0 55| =================== S L A P Column format ================== SLAP Column format. In this format the non-zeros are stored counting down columns (except for the diagonal entry, which must appear first in each "column") and are stored in the double precision array A. In other words, for each column in the matrix put the diagonal entry in A. Then put in the other non-zero elements going down the column (except the diagonal) in order. The IA array holds the row index for each non-zero. The JA array holds the offsets into the IA, A arrays for the beginning of each column. That is,

### Arguments

| # | Argument | Direction | Role | Fortran type | Rust raw type | Shape | Contract |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `N` | `input` | `scalar` | `INTEGER` | `*mut crate::FortranInteger` | scalar | Order of the Matrix. |
| 2 | `NELT` | `input` | `scalar` | `INTEGER` | `*mut crate::FortranInteger` | scalar | Integer. Number of non-zeros stored in A. |
| 3 | `IA` | `input-output` | `array` | `INTEGER` | `*mut crate::FortranInteger` | rank 1; dimensions (NELT) | IA(NELT). A(JA(ICOL)) points to the beginning of the ICOL-th column in IA and A. IA(JA(ICOL+1)-1), A(JA(ICOL+1)-1) points to the end of the ICOL-th column. Note that we always have JA(N+1) = NELT+1, where N is the number of columns in the matrix and NELT is the number of non-zeros in the matrix. Here is an example of the SLAP Column storage format for a 5x5 Matrix (in the A and IA arrays '\|' denotes the end of a column): 5x5 Matrix SLAP Column format for 5x5 matrix on left. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 \|11 12 0 0 15\| A: 11 21 51 \| 22 12 \| 33 53 \| 44 \| 55 15 35 \|21 22 0 0 0\| IA: 1 2 5 \| 2 1 \| 3 5 \| 4 \| 5 1 3 \| 0 0 33 0 35\| JA: 1 4 6 8 9 12 \| 0 0 0 44 0\| \|51 0 53 0 55\|. |
| 4 | `JA` | `input-output` | `array` | `INTEGER` | `*mut crate::FortranInteger` | rank 1; dimensions (NELT) | JA(NELT). |
| 5 | `A` | `input-output` | `array` | `DOUBLE PRECISION` | `*mut f64` | rank 1; dimensions (NELT) | Double Precision A(NELT). These arrays should hold the matrix A in either the SLAP Triad format or the SLAP Column format. See "Description", below. If the SLAP Triad format is used, this format is translated to the SLAP Column format by this routine. |
| 6 | `ISYM` | `input` | `scalar` | `INTEGER` | `*mut crate::FortranInteger` | scalar | Integer. Flag to indicate symmetric storage format. If ISYM=0, all non-zero entries of the matrix are stored. If ISYM=1, the matrix is symmetric, and only the lower triangle of the matrix is stored. |

The authoritative public-documentation inventory records argument evidence ranges, nullability, shapes, relationships, leading dimensions, option values, and overwrite behavior. Native code does not retain ordinary argument pointers.

### Return value

This is a Fortran subroutine and has no direct return value; outputs are documented in its argument contract.

### Storage and array requirements

Array arguments use Fortran column-major storage and must satisfy their documented shape and leading-dimension relationships.

### Provider, ABI, and safety

Canonical Rust path: `slatec_sys::blas::level1::ds2y`. Native symbol: `ds2y_`. Declaration feature: `blas-level1`. Provider feature: `blas-level1`. ABI fingerprint: `unavailable`.

# Safety

Every pointer must be non-null unless its argument record explicitly permits null, correctly aligned, and valid for its documented readable or writable extent. Callers must preserve Fortran column-major layout, dimensions, leading dimensions, workspace capacity, callback lifetime, and the selected provider's runtime serialization requirements. Mutable arguments may not alias in a way the native routine does not permit.
