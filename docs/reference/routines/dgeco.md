## Purpose

Factor a matrix using Gaussian elimination and estimate the condition number of the matrix.

## Description

DGECO factors a double precision matrix by Gaussian elimination and estimates the condition of the matrix. If RCOND is not needed, DGEFA is slightly faster. To solve A*X = B , follow DGECO by DGESL. To compute INVERSE(A)*C , follow DGECO by DGESL. To compute DETERMINANT(A) , follow DGECO by DGEDI. To compute INVERSE(A) , follow DGECO by DGEDI. On Entry A DOUBLE PRECISION(LDA, N) the matrix to be factored. LDA INTEGER the leading dimension of the array A . N INTEGER the order of the matrix A . On Return A an upper triangular matrix and the multipliers which were used to obtain it. The factorization can be written A = L*U where L is a product of permutation and unit lower triangular matrices and U is upper triangular. IPVT INTEGER(N) an INTEGER vector of pivot indices. RCOND DOUBLE PRECISION an estimate of the reciprocal condition of A . For the system A*X = B , relative perturbations in A and B of size EPSILON may cause relative perturbations in X of size EPSILON/RCOND . If RCOND is so small that the logical expression 1.0 + RCOND .EQ. 1.0 is true, then A may be singular to working precision. In particular, RCOND is zero if exact singularity is detected or the estimate underflows. Z DOUBLE PRECISION(N) a work vector whose contents are usually unimportant. If A is close to a singular matrix, then Z is an approximate null vector in the sense that NORM(A*Z) = RCOND*NORM(A)*NORM(Z) .
