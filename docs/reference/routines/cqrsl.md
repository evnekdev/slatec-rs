## Purpose

Apply the output of CQRDC to compute coordinate transformations, projections, and least squares solutions.

## Description

CQRSL applies the output of CQRDC to compute coordinate transformations, projections, and least squares solutions. For K .LE. MIN(N,P), let XK be the matrix XK = (X(JVPT(1)),X(JVPT(2)), ... ,X(JVPT(K))) formed from columns JVPT(1), ... ,JVPT(K) of the original N x P matrix X that was input to CQRDC (if no pivoting was done, XK consists of the first K columns of X in their original order). CQRDC produces a factored unitary matrix Q and an upper triangular matrix R such that XK = Q * (R) (0) This information is contained in coded form in the arrays X and QRAUX. On Entry X COMPLEX(LDX,P). X contains the output of CQRDC. LDX INTEGER. LDX is the leading dimension of the array X. N INTEGER. N is the number of rows of the matrix XK. It must have the same value as N in CQRDC. K INTEGER. K is the number of columns of the matrix XK. K must not be greater than (N,P), where P is the same as in the calling sequence to CQRDC. QRAUX COMPLEX(P). QRAUX contains the auxiliary output from CQRDC. Y COMPLEX(N) Y contains an N-vector that is to be manipulated by CQRSL. JOB INTEGER. JOB specifies what is to be computed. JOB has the decimal expansion ABCDE, with the following meaning. If A .NE. 0, compute QY. If B,C,D, or E .NE. 0, compute QTY. If C .NE. 0, compute B. If D .NE. 0, compute RSD . If E .NE. 0, compute XB. Note that a request to compute B, RSD, or XB automatically triggers the computation of QTY, for which an array must be provided in the calling sequence. On Return QY COMPLEX(N). QY contains Q*Y, if its computation has been requested. QTY COMPLEX(N). QTY contains CTRANS(Q)*Y, if its computation has been requested. Here CTRANS(Q) is the conjugate transpose of the matrix Q. B COMPLEX(K) B contains the solution of the least squares problem minimize NORM2(Y - XK*B), if its computation has been requested. (Note that if pivoting was requested in CQRDC, the J-th component of B will be associated with column JVPT(J) of the original matrix X that was input into CQRDC.) RSD COMPLEX(N). RSD contains the least squares residual Y - XK*B, if its computation has been requested. RSD is also the orthogonal projection of Y onto the orthogonal complement of the column space of XK. XB COMPLEX(N). XB contains the least squares approximation XK*B, if its computation has been requested. XB is also the orthogonal projection of Y onto the column space of X. INFO INTEGER. INFO is zero unless the computation of B has been requested and R is exactly singular. In this case, INFO is the index of the first zero diagonal element of R and B is left unaltered. The parameters QY, QTY, B, RSD, and XB are not referenced if their computation is not requested and in this case can be replaced by dummy variables in the calling program. To save storage, the user may in some cases use the same array for different parameters in the calling sequence. A frequently occurring example is when one wishes to compute any of B, RSD, or XB and does not need Y or QTY. In this case one may identify Y, QTY, and one of B, RSD, or XB, while providing separate arrays for anything else that is to be computed. Thus the calling sequence CALL CQRSL(X,LDX,N,K,QRAUX,Y,DUM,Y,B,Y,DUM,110,INFO) will result in the computation of B and RSD, with RSD overwriting Y. More generally, each item in the following list contains groups of permissible identifications for a single calling sequence. 1. (Y,QTY,B) (RSD) (XB) (QY) 2. (Y,QTY,RSD) (B) (XB) (QY) 3. (Y,QTY,XB) (B) (RSD) (QY) 4. (Y,QY) (QTY,B) (RSD) (XB) 5. (Y,QY) (QTY,RSD) (B) (XB) 6. (Y,QY) (QTY,XB) (B) (RSD) In any group the value returned in the array allocated to the group corresponds to the last member of the group.

Argument evidence records nullability, shape, relationships, leading dimensions, workspace rules, options, and overwrite behavior in the authoritative public-documentation inventory. Native code does not retain ordinary argument pointers.

### Return value

This is a Fortran subroutine and has no direct return value; outputs are documented in its argument contract.

### Callback contract

This interface declares no callback argument.

### Error and status values

The selected source does not provide a separate error-status section. Any status output argument is identified in the argument table; callers must also respect the legacy SLATEC error-runtime behavior described by the source.

### Storage and workspace requirements

This interface declares no separately named workspace argument. Array storage, if any, is Fortran column-major and must satisfy the documented shape and leading-dimension relationships.

### Provider, ABI, and safety

Canonical Rust path: `slatec_sys::linear_algebra::dense::complex::cqrsl`. Native symbol: `cqrsl_`. Declaration feature: `linear-algebra-complex`. Provider feature: `linear-algebra-complex`. ABI fingerprint: `subroutine:void(mut_complex32_array_rank2,mut_i32,mut_i32,mut_i32,mut_complex32_array_rank1,mut_complex32_array_rank1,mut_complex32_array_rank1,mut_complex32_array_rank1,mut_complex32_array_rank1,mut_complex32_array_rank1,mut_complex32_array_rank1,mut_i32,mut_i32)`.

# Safety

Every pointer must be non-null unless its argument record explicitly permits null, correctly aligned, and valid for its documented readable or writable extent. Callers must preserve Fortran column-major layout, dimensions, leading dimensions, workspace capacity, callback lifetime, and the selected provider's runtime serialization requirements. Mutable arguments may not alias in a way the native routine does not permit.
