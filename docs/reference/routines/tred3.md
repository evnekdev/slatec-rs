## Purpose

Reduce a real symmetric matrix stored in packed form to symmetric tridiagonal matrix using orthogonal transformations.

## Description

This subroutine is a translation of the ALGOL procedure TRED3, NUM. MATH. 11, 181-195(1968) by Martin, Reinsch, and Wilkinson. HANDBOOK FOR AUTO. COMP., VOL.II-LINEAR ALGEBRA, 212-226(1971). This subroutine reduces a REAL SYMMETRIC matrix, stored as a one-dimensional array, to a symmetric tridiagonal matrix using orthogonal similarity transformations. On Input N is the order of the matrix A. N is an INTEGER variable. NV is an INTEGER variable set equal to the dimension of the array A as specified in the calling program. NV must not be less than N*(N+1)/2. A contains the lower triangle, stored row-wise, of the real symmetric packed matrix. A is a one-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned A(NV). On Output A contains information about the orthogonal transformations used in the reduction in its first N*(N+1)/2 positions. D contains the diagonal elements of the symmetric tridiagonal matrix. D is a one-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned D(N). E contains the subdiagonal elements of the symmetric tridiagonal matrix in its last N-1 positions. E(1) is set to zero. E is a one-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned E(N). E2 contains the squares of the corresponding elements of E. E2 may coincide with E if the squares are not needed. E2 is a one-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned E2(N). Questions and comments should be directed to B. S.

### Arguments

| # | Argument | Direction | Role | Fortran type | Rust raw type | Shape | Contract |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `N` | `input` | `scalar` | `INTEGER` | `*mut crate::FortranInteger` | scalar | Scalar argument classified by fixed-form executable read/write analysis. |
| 2 | `NV` | `input` | `scalar` | `INTEGER` | `*mut crate::FortranInteger` | scalar | Scalar argument classified by fixed-form executable read/write analysis. |
| 3 | `A` | `input-output` | `array` | `REAL` | `*mut f32` | rank 1; dimensions (*) | Array argument classified by fixed-form executable read/write analysis. |
| 4 | `D` | `input-output` | `array` | `REAL` | `*mut f32` | rank 1; dimensions (*) | Array argument classified by fixed-form executable read/write analysis. |
| 5 | `E` | `input-output` | `array` | `REAL` | `*mut f32` | rank 1; dimensions (*) | Array argument classified by fixed-form executable read/write analysis. |
| 6 | `E2` | `output` | `array` | `REAL` | `*mut f32` | rank 1; dimensions (*) | Array argument classified by fixed-form executable read/write analysis. |

Argument evidence records nullability, shape, relationships, leading dimensions, workspace rules, options, and overwrite behavior in the authoritative public-documentation inventory. Native code does not retain ordinary argument pointers.

### Return value

This is a Fortran subroutine and has no direct return value; outputs are documented in its argument contract.

### Callback contract

This interface declares no callback argument.

### Error and status values

The selected source does not provide a separate error-status section. Any status output argument is identified in the argument table; callers must also respect the legacy SLATEC error-runtime behavior described by the source.

### Storage and workspace requirements

This interface declares no separately named workspace argument. Array storage, if any, is Fortran column-major and must satisfy the documented shape and leading-dimension relationships.

### Provider, ABI, and safety

Canonical Rust path: `slatec_sys::linear_algebra::eigen::tred3`. Native symbol: `tred3_`. Declaration feature: `eigen`. Provider feature: `linear-algebra-eigen`. ABI fingerprint: `subroutine:void(mut_i32,mut_i32,mut_f32_ptr_rank1,mut_f32_ptr_rank1,mut_f32_ptr_rank1,mut_f32_ptr_rank1)`.

# Safety

Every pointer must be non-null unless its argument record explicitly permits null, correctly aligned, and valid for its documented readable or writable extent. Callers must preserve Fortran column-major layout, dimensions, leading dimensions, workspace capacity, callback lifetime, and the selected provider's runtime serialization requirements. Mutable arguments may not alias in a way the native routine does not permit.
