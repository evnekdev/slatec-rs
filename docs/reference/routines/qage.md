## Purpose

The routine calculates an approximation result to a given definite integral I = Integral of F over (A,B), hopefully satisfying following claim for accuracy ABS(I-RESLT).LE.MAX(EPSABS,EPSREL*ABS(I)).

## Description

Computation of a definite integral Standard fortran subroutine Real version PARAMETERS ON ENTRY F - Real Function subprogram defining the integrand function F(X). The actual name for F needs to be declared E X T E R N A L in the driver program. A - Real Lower limit of integration B - Real Upper limit of integration EPSABS - Real Absolute accuracy requested EPSREL - Real Relative accuracy requested If EPSABS.LE.0 and EPSREL.LT.MAX(50*REL.MACH.ACC.,0.5D-28), the routine will end with IER = 6. KEY - Integer Key for choice of local integration rule A Gauss-Kronrod pair is used with 7 - 15 points if KEY.LT.2, 10 - 21 points if KEY = 2, 15 - 31 points if KEY = 3, 20 - 41 points if KEY = 4, 25 - 51 points if KEY = 5, 30 - 61 points if KEY.GT.5. LIMIT - Integer Gives an upper bound on the number of subintervals in the partition of (A,B), LIMIT.GE.1. ON RETURN RESULT - Real Approximation to the integral ABSERR - Real Estimate of the modulus of the absolute error, which should equal or exceed ABS(I-RESULT) NEVAL - Integer Number of integrand evaluations IER - Integer IER = 0 Normal and reliable termination of the routine. It is assumed that the requested accuracy has been achieved. IER.GT.0 Abnormal termination of the routine The estimates for result and error are less reliable. It is assumed that the requested accuracy has not been achieved. ERROR MESSAGES IER = 1 Maximum number of subdivisions allowed has been achieved. One can allow more subdivisions by increasing the value of LIMIT. However, if this yields no improvement it is rather advised to analyze the integrand in order to determine the integration difficulties. If the position of a local difficulty can be determined(e.g. SINGULARITY, DISCONTINUITY within the interval) one will probably gain from splitting up the interval at this point and calling the integrator on the subranges. If possible, an appropriate special-purpose integrator should be used which is designed for handling the type of difficulty involved. = 2 The occurrence of roundoff error is detected, which prevents the requested tolerance from being achieved. = 3 Extremely bad integrand behaviour occurs at some points of the integration interval. = 6 The input is invalid, because (EPSABS.LE.0 and EPSREL.LT.MAX(50*REL.MACH.ACC.,0.5D-28), RESULT, ABSERR, NEVAL, LAST, RLIST(1) , ELIST(1) and IORD(1) are set to zero. ALIST(1) and BLIST(1) are set to A and B respectively. ALIST - Real Vector of dimension at least LIMIT, the first LAST elements of which are the left
