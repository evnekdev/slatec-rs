## Purpose

Compute the eigenvalues and, optionally, the eigenvectors of a real symmetric tridiagonal matrix.

## Description

This subroutine calls the recommended sequence of subroutines from the eigensystem subroutine package (EISPACK) to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors (if desired) of a REAL SYMMETRIC TRIDIAGONAL matrix. On Input NM must be set to the row dimension of the two-dimensional array parameter, Z, as declared in the calling program dimension statement. NM is an INTEGER variable. N is the order of the matrix. N is an INTEGER variable. N must be less than or equal to NM. W contains the diagonal elements of the real symmetric tridiagonal matrix. W is a one-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned W(N). E contains the subdiagonal elements of the matrix in its last N-1 positions. E(1) is arbitrary. E is a one-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned E(N). MATZ is an INTEGER variable set equal to zero if only eigenvalues are desired. Otherwise, it is set to any non-zero integer for both eigenvalues and eigenvectors. On Output W contains the eigenvalues in ascending order. Z contains the eigenvectors if MATZ is not zero. The eigenvectors are orthonormal. Z is a two-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned Z(NM,N). IERR is an INTEGER flag set to Zero for normal return, 10*N if N is greater than NM, J if the J-th eigenvalue has not been determined after 30 iterations. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors in the W and Z arrays should be correct for indices 1, 2, ..., IERR-1. Questions and comments should be directed to B. S.
