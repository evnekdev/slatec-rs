[Family: Special functions](../families/special-functions.md) | [All families](../routines-by-family.md) | [Alphabetical index](../routines-alphabetical.md) | [Coverage](../routine-coverage.md)

## Purpose

Compute an N member sequence of I Bessel functions I/SUB(ALPHA+K-1)/(X), K=1,...,N or scaled Bessel functions EXP(-X)*I/SUB(ALPHA+K-1)/(X), K=1,...,N for non-negative ALPHA and X.

## Description

BESI computes an N member sequence of I Bessel functions I/sub(ALPHA+K-1)/(X), K=1,...,N or scaled Bessel functions EXP(-X)*I/sub(ALPHA+K-1)/(X), K=1,...,N for non-negative ALPHA and X. A combination of the power series, the asymptotic expansion for X to infinity, and the uniform asymptotic expansion for NU to infinity are applied over subdivisions of the (NU,X) plane. For values not covered by one of these formulae, the order is incremented by an integer so that one of these formulae apply. Backward recursion is used to reduce orders by integer values. The asymptotic expansion for X to infinity is used only when the entire sequence (specifically the last member) lies within the region covered by the expansion. Leading terms of these expansions are used to test for over or underflow where appropriate. If a sequence is requested and the last member would underflow, the result is set to zero and the next lower order tried, etc., until a member comes on scale or all are set to zero. An overflow cannot occur with scaling.

Argument evidence records nullability, shape, relationships, leading dimensions, workspace rules, options, and overwrite behavior in the authoritative public-documentation inventory. Native code does not retain ordinary argument pointers.

### Return value

This is a Fortran subroutine and has no direct return value; outputs are documented in its argument contract.

### Callback contract

This interface declares no callback argument.

### Error and status values

The selected source does not provide a separate error-status section. Any status output argument is identified in the argument table; callers must also respect the legacy SLATEC error-runtime behavior described by the source.

### Storage and workspace requirements

This interface declares no separately named workspace argument. Array storage, if any, is Fortran column-major and must satisfy the documented shape and leading-dimension relationships.

### Provider, ABI, and safety

Canonical Rust path: `slatec_sys::special::bessel::besi`. Native symbol: `besi_`. Declaration feature: `special`. Provider feature: `special-real`. ABI fingerprint: `subroutine:void(mut_f32,mut_f32,mut_i32,mut_i32,mut_f32_ptr_rank1,mut_i32)`.

# Safety

Every pointer must be non-null unless its argument record explicitly permits null, correctly aligned, and valid for its documented readable or writable extent. Callers must preserve Fortran column-major layout, dimensions, leading dimensions, workspace capacity, callback lifetime, and the selected provider's runtime serialization requirements. Mutable arguments may not alias in a way the native routine does not permit.
