[Family: Special functions](../families/special-functions.md) | [All families](../routines-by-family.md) | [Alphabetical index](../routines-alphabetical.md) | [Coverage](../routine-coverage.md)

## Purpose

Compute an N member sequence of I Bessel functions I/SUB(ALPHA+K-1)/(X), K=1,...,N or scaled Bessel functions EXP(-X)*I/SUB(ALPHA+K-1)/(X), K=1,...,N for non-negative ALPHA and X.

## Description

Abstract BESI computes an N member sequence of I Bessel functions I/sub(ALPHA+K-1)/(X), K=1,...,N or scaled Bessel functions EXP(-X)*I/sub(ALPHA+K-1)/(X), K=1,...,N for non-negative ALPHA and X. A combination of the power series, the asymptotic expansion for X to infinity, and the uniform asymptotic expansion for NU to infinity are applied over subdivisions of the (NU,X) plane. For values not covered by one of these formulae, the order is incremented by an integer so that one of these formulae apply. Backward recursion is used to reduce orders by integer values. The asymptotic expansion for X to infinity is used only when the entire sequence (specifically the last member) lies within the region covered by the expansion. Leading terms of these expansions are used to test for over or underflow where appropriate. If a sequence is requested and the last member would underflow, the result is set to zero and the next lower order tried, etc., until a member comes on scale or all are set to zero. An overflow cannot occur with scaling. Description of Arguments

The table reports compiler/interface facts separately from source-prologue semantics. Unknown intent, aliasing, workspace, leading-dimension, and retention rules remain explicit; parameter names alone are never treated as semantic evidence. Native code does not retain ordinary argument pointers unless a reviewed declaration explicitly says otherwise.

### ABI and safety

Canonical path: `slatec_sys::special::bessel::besi`. Native symbol: `besi_`. Feature: `special`. Provider status: `selected_provider_verified`. ABI fingerprint: `subroutine:void(mut_f32,mut_f32,mut_i32,mut_i32,mut_f32_ptr_rank1,mut_i32)`. Every pointer must be aligned and valid for the full source-defined readable or writable extent; callers must uphold array dimensions, leading dimensions, workspace formulas, aliasing restrictions, callback lifetimes, and process-global runtime serialization.
