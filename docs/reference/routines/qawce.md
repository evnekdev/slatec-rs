## Purpose

The routine calculates an approximation result to a CAUCHY PRINCIPAL VALUE I = Integral of F*W over (A,B) (W(X) = 1/(X-C), (C.NE.A, C.NE.B), hopefully satisfying following claim for accuracy ABS(I-RESULT).LE.MAX(EPSABS,EPSREL*ABS(I))

## Description

Computation of a CAUCHY PRINCIPAL VALUE Standard fortran subroutine Real version PARAMETERS ON ENTRY F - Real Function subprogram defining the integrand function F(X). The actual name for F needs to be declared E X T E R N A L in the driver program. A - Real Lower limit of integration B - Real Upper limit of integration C - Real Parameter in the WEIGHT function, C.NE.A, C.NE.B If C = A OR C = B, the routine will end with IER = 6. EPSABS - Real Absolute accuracy requested EPSREL - Real Relative accuracy requested If EPSABS.LE.0 and EPSREL.LT.MAX(50*REL.MACH.ACC.,0.5D-28), the routine will end with IER = 6. LIMIT - Integer Gives an upper bound on the number of subintervals in the partition of (A,B), LIMIT.GE.1 ON RETURN RESULT - Real Approximation to the integral ABSERR - Real Estimate of the modulus of the absolute error, which should equal or exceed ABS(I-RESULT) NEVAL - Integer Number of integrand evaluations IER - Integer IER = 0 Normal and reliable termination of the routine. It is assumed that the requested accuracy has been achieved. IER.GT.0 Abnormal termination of the routine the estimates for integral and error are less reliable. It is assumed that the requested accuracy has not been achieved. ERROR MESSAGES IER = 1 Maximum number of subdivisions allowed has been achieved. One can allow more subdivisions by increasing the value of LIMIT. However, if this yields no improvement it is advised to analyze the the integrand, in order to determine the the integration difficulties. If the position of a local difficulty can be determined (e.g. SINGULARITY, DISCONTINUITY within the interval) one will probably gain from splitting up the interval at this point and calling appropriate integrators on the subranges. = 2 The occurrence of roundoff error is detected, which prevents the requested tolerance from being achieved. = 3 Extremely bad integrand behaviour occurs at some interior points of the integration interval. = 6 The input is invalid, because C = A or C = B or (EPSABS.LE.0 and EPSREL.LT.MAX(50*REL.MACH.ACC.,0.5D-28)) or LIMIT.LT.1. RESULT, ABSERR, NEVAL, RLIST(1), ELIST(1), IORD(1) and LAST are set to zero. ALIST(1) and BLIST(1) are set to A and B respectively. ALIST - Real Vector of dimension at least LIMIT, the first LAST elements of which are the left
