## Purpose

Incomplete LU BiConjugate Gradient Sparse Ax=b Solver. Routine to solve a linear system Ax = b using the BiConjugate Gradient method with Incomplete LU decomposition preconditioning.

## Description

Usage: INTEGER N, NELT, IA(NELT), JA(NELT), ISYM, ITOL, ITMAX INTEGER ITER, IERR, IUNIT, LENW, IWORK(NL+NU+4*N+2), LENIW DOUBLE PRECISION B(N), X(N), A(NELT), TOL, ERR, RWORK(NL+NU+8*N) CALL DSLUBC(N, B, X, NELT, IA, JA, A, ISYM, ITOL, TOL, $ ITMAX, ITER, ERR, IERR, IUNIT, RWORK, LENW, IWORK, LENIW) This routine is simply a driver for the DBCGN routine. It calls the DSILUS routine to set up the preconditioning and then calls DBCGN with the appropriate MATVEC, MTTVEC and MSOLVE, MTSOLV routines. The Sparse Linear Algebra Package (SLAP) utilizes two matrix data structures: 1) the SLAP Triad format or 2) the SLAP Column format. The user can hand this routine either of the of these data structures and SLAP will figure out which on is being used and act accordingly. =================== S L A P Triad format =================== This routine requires that the matrix A be stored in the SLAP Triad format. In this format only the non-zeros are stored. They may appear in *ANY* order. The user supplies three arrays of length NELT, where NELT is the number of non-zeros in the matrix: (IA(NELT), JA(NELT), A(NELT)). For each non-zero the user puts the row and column index of that matrix element in the IA and JA arrays. The value of the non-zero matrix element is placed in the corresponding location of the A array. This is an extremely easy data structure to generate. On the other hand it is not too efficient on vector computers for the iterative solution of linear systems. Hence, SLAP changes this input data structure to the SLAP Column format for the iteration (but does not change it back). Here is an example of the SLAP Triad storage format for a 5x5 Matrix. Recall that the entries may appear in any order. 5x5 Matrix SLAP Triad format for 5x5 matrix on left. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 |11 12 0 0 15| A: 51 12 11 33 15 53 55 22 35 44 21 |21 22 0 0 0| IA: 5 1 1 3 1 5 5 2 3 4 2 | 0 0 33 0 35| JA: 1 2 1 3 5 3 5 2 5 4 1 | 0 0 0 44 0| |51 0 53 0 55| =================== S L A P Column format ================== This routine requires that the matrix A be stored in the SLAP Column format. In this format the non-zeros are stored counting down columns (except for the diagonal entry, which must appear first in each "column") and are stored in the double precision array A. In other words, for each column in the matrix put the diagonal entry in A. Then put in the other non-zero elements going down the column (except the diagonal) in order. The IA array holds the row index for each non-zero. The JA array holds the offsets into the IA, A arrays for the beginning of each column. That is, IA(JA(ICOL)), A(JA(ICOL)) points to the beginning of the ICOL-th column in IA and A. IA(JA(ICOL+1)-1), A(JA(ICOL+1)-1) points to the end of the ICOL-th column. Note that we always have JA(N+1) = NELT+1, where N is the number of columns in the matrix and NELT is the number of non-zeros in the matrix. Here is an example of the SLAP Column storage format for a 5x5 Matrix (in the A and IA arrays '|' denotes the end of a column): 5x5 Matrix SLAP Column format for 5x5 matrix on left. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 |11 12 0 0 15| A: 11 21 51 | 22 12 | 33 53 | 44 | 55 15 35 |21 22 0 0 0| IA: 1 2 5 | 2 1 | 3 5 | 4 | 5 1 3 | 0 0 33 0 35| JA: 1 4 6 8 9 12 | 0 0 0 44 0| |51 0 53 0 55| Side Effects: The SLAP Triad format (IA, JA, A) is modified internally to be the SLAP Column format. See above. Cautions: This routine will attempt to write to the Fortran logical output unit IUNIT, if IUNIT .ne. 0. Thus, the user must make sure that this logical unit is attached to a file or terminal before calling this routine with a non-zero value for IUNIT. This routine does not check for the validity of a non-zero IUNIT unit number.

### Callback contract

This interface declares no callback argument.

### Error and status values

much less than TOL) through a common block, COMMON /DSLBLK/ SOLN( ) If ITOL=11, iteration stops when the 2-norm of the difference between the iterative approximation and the user-supplied solution divided by the 2-norm of the user-supplied solution is less than TOL.  Note that this requires the user to set up the "COMMON /DSLBLK/ SOLN(LENGTH)" in the calling routine. The routine with this declaration should be loaded before the stop test so that the correct length is used by the loader. This procedure is not standard Fortran and may not work correctly on your system (although it has worked on every system the authors have tried).  If ITOL is not 11 then this common block is indeed standard Fortran. TOL    :INOUT    Double Precision. Convergence criterion, as described above.  (Reset if IERR=4.) ITMAX  :IN       Integer. Maximum number of iterations. ITER   :OUT      Integer. Number of iterations required to reach convergence, or ITMAX+1 if convergence criterion could not be achieved in ITMAX iterations. ERR    :OUT      Double Precision. defined by ITOL. IERR   :OUT      Integer. IERR = 0 => All went well. IERR = 1 => Insufficient space allocated for WORK or IWORK. IERR = 2 => Method failed to converge in ITMAX steps. Check input values of N, ITOL. Reset to 500*D1MACH(3).  Iteration proceeded. IERR = 5 => Preconditioning matrix, M, is not positive definite.  (r,z) < 0. IERR = 6 => Matrix A is not positive definite.  (p,Ap) < 0. IERR = 7 => Incomplete factorization broke down and was fudged.  Resulting preconditioning may be less than the best. IUNIT  :IN       Integer. if this is desired for monitoring convergence.  If unit number is 0, no writing will occur. RWORK  :WORK     Double Precision RWORK(LENW). Double Precision array used for workspace. LENW   :IN       Integer. Length of the double precision workspace, RWORK. LENW >= NL+NU+8*N. NL is the number of non-zeros in the lower triangle of the matrix (including the diagonal). NU is the number of non-zeros in the upper triangle of the matrix (including the diagonal). IWORK  :WORK     Integer IWORK(LENIW). Integer array used for workspace. Upon return the following locations of IWORK hold information which may be of use to the user: IWORK(9)  Amount of Integer workspace actually used. IWORK(10) Amount of Double Precision workspace actually used. LENIW  :IN       Integer. Length of the integer workspace, IWORK. LENIW >= NL+NU+4*N+12. NL is the number of non-zeros in the lower triangle of the matrix (including the diagonal). NU is the number of non-zeros in the upper triangle of the matrix (including the diagonal).

### Provider, ABI, and safety

ABI fingerprint: `subroutine:void(mut_i32,mut_f64_ptr_rank1,mut_f64_ptr_rank1,mut_i32,mut_i32_ptr_rank1,mut_i32_ptr_rank1,mut_f64_ptr_rank1,mut_i32,mut_i32,mut_f64,mut_i32,mut_i32,mut_f64,mut_i32,mut_i32,mut_f64_ptr_rank1,mut_i32,mut_i32_ptr_rank1,mut_i32)`.

# Safety

Every pointer must be non-null unless its argument record explicitly permits null, correctly aligned, and valid for its documented readable or writable extent. Callers must preserve Fortran column-major layout, dimensions, leading dimensions, workspace capacity, callback lifetime, and the selected provider's runtime serialization requirements. Mutable arguments may not alias in a way the native routine does not permit.
