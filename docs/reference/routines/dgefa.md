# DGEFA

[Back to family index](../routines-by-family.md) · [Alphabetical index](../routines-alphabetical.md) · [Coverage](../routine-coverage.md)

## Purpose

Factor a matrix using Gaussian elimination.

## Description

DGEFA factors a double precision matrix by Gaussian elimination. DGEFA is usually called by DGECO, but it can be called directly with a saving in time if RCOND is not needed. (Time for DGECO) = (1 + 9/N)*(Time for DGEFA) . On Entry A DOUBLE PRECISION(LDA, N) the matrix to be factored. LDA INTEGER the leading dimension of the array A . N INTEGER the order of the matrix A . On Return A an upper triangular matrix and the multipliers which were used to obtain it. The factorization can be written A = L*U where L is a product of permutation and unit lower triangular matrices and U is upper triangular. IPVT INTEGER(N) an integer vector of pivot indices. INFO INTEGER = 0 normal value. = K if U(K,K) .EQ. 0.0 . This is not an error condition for this subroutine, but it does indicate that DGESL or DGEDI will divide by zero if called. Use RCOND in DGECO for a reliable indication of singularity.
