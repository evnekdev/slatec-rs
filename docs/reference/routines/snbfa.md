## Purpose

Factor a real band matrix by elimination.

## Description

SNBFA factors a real band matrix by elimination. SNBFA is usually called by SNBCO, but it can be called directly with a saving in time if RCOND is not needed. On Entry ABE REAL(LDA, NC) contains the matrix in band storage. The rows of the original matrix are stored in the rows of ABE and the diagonals of the original matrix are stored in columns 1 through ML+MU+1 of ABE. NC must be .GE. 2*ML+MU+1 . See the comments below for details. LDA INTEGER the leading dimension of the array ABE. LDA must be .GE. N . N INTEGER the order of the original matrix. ML INTEGER number of diagonals below the main diagonal. 0 .LE. ML .LT. N . MU INTEGER number of diagonals above the main diagonal. 0 .LE. MU .LT. N . More efficient if ML .LE. MU . On Return ABE an upper triangular matrix in band storage and the multipliers which were used to obtain it. The factorization can be written A = L*U , where L is a product of permutation and unit lower triangular matrices and U is upper triangular. IPVT INTEGER(N) an integer vector of pivot indices. INFO INTEGER =0 normal value

Argument evidence records nullability, shape, relationships, leading dimensions, workspace rules, options, and overwrite behavior in the authoritative public-documentation inventory. Native code does not retain ordinary argument pointers.

### Return value

This is a Fortran subroutine and has no direct return value; outputs are documented in its argument contract.

### Callback contract

This interface declares no callback argument.

### Error and status values

condition for this subroutine, but it does indicate that SNBSL will divide by zero if called.  Use RCOND in SNBCO for a reliable indication of singularity. Band Storage If  A  is a band matrix, the following program segment will set up the input. ML = (band width below the diagonal) MU = (band width above the diagonal) DO 20 I = 1, N J1 = MAX(1, I-ML) J2 = MIN(N, I+MU) DO 10 J = J1, J2 K = J - I + ML + 1 ABE(I,K) = A(I,J) 10    CONTINUE 20 CONTINUE This uses columns  1  through  ML+MU+1  of ABE . Furthermore,  ML  additional columns are needed in ABE  starting with column  ML+MU+2  for elements generated during the triangularization.  The total number of columns needed in  ABE  is  2*ML+MU+1 . Example:  If the original matrix is 11 12 13  0  0  0 21 22 23 24  0  0 0 32 33 34 35  0 0  0 43 44 45 46 0  0  0 54 55 56 0  0  0  0 65 66 then  N = 6, ML = 1, MU = 2, LDA .GE. 5  and ABE should contain 11 12 13  +     , * = not used 21 22 23 24  +     , + = used for pivoting 32 33 34 35  + 43 44 45 46  + 54 55 56  *  + 65 66  *  *  +

### Storage and workspace requirements

This interface declares no separately named workspace argument. Array storage, if any, is Fortran column-major and must satisfy the documented shape and leading-dimension relationships.

### Provider, ABI, and safety

Canonical Rust path: `slatec_sys::linear_algebra::banded::snbfa`. Native symbol: `snbfa_`. Declaration feature: `linear-algebra`. Provider feature: `linear-algebra-real`. ABI fingerprint: `subroutine:void(mut_f32_ptr_rank2,mut_i32,mut_i32,mut_i32,mut_i32,mut_i32_ptr_rank1,mut_i32)`.

# Safety

Every pointer must be non-null unless its argument record explicitly permits null, correctly aligned, and valid for its documented readable or writable extent. Callers must preserve Fortran column-major layout, dimensions, leading dimensions, workspace capacity, callback lifetime, and the selected provider's runtime serialization requirements. Mutable arguments may not alias in a way the native routine does not permit.
