## Purpose

Factor a real band matrix by elimination.

## Description

SNBFA factors a real band matrix by elimination. SNBFA is usually called by SNBCO, but it can be called directly with a saving in time if RCOND is not needed. On Entry ABE REAL(LDA, NC) contains the matrix in band storage. The rows of the original matrix are stored in the rows of ABE and the diagonals of the original matrix are stored in columns 1 through ML+MU+1 of ABE. NC must be .GE. 2*ML+MU+1 . See the comments below for details. LDA INTEGER the leading dimension of the array ABE. LDA must be .GE. N . N INTEGER the order of the original matrix. ML INTEGER number of diagonals below the main diagonal. 0 .LE. ML .LT. N . MU INTEGER number of diagonals above the main diagonal. 0 .LE. MU .LT. N . More efficient if ML .LE. MU . On Return ABE an upper triangular matrix in band storage and the multipliers which were used to obtain it. The factorization can be written A = L*U , where L is a product of permutation and unit lower triangular matrices and U is upper triangular. IPVT INTEGER(N) an integer vector of pivot indices. INFO INTEGER =0 normal value =K if U(K,K) .EQ. 0.0 . This is not an error condition for this subroutine, but it does indicate that SNBSL will divide by zero if called. Use RCOND in SNBCO for a reliable indication of singularity. Band Storage If A is a band matrix, the following program segment will set up the input. ML = (band width below the diagonal) MU = (band width above the diagonal) DO 20 I = 1, N J1 = MAX(1, I-ML) J2 = MIN(N, I+MU) DO 10 J = J1, J2 K = J - I + ML + 1 ABE(I,K) = A(I,J) 10 CONTINUE 20 CONTINUE This uses columns 1 through ML+MU+1 of ABE . Furthermore, ML additional columns are needed in ABE starting with column ML+MU+2 for elements generated during the triangularization. The total number of columns needed in ABE is 2*ML+MU+1 . Example: If the original matrix is 11 12 13 0 0 0 21 22 23 24 0 0 0 32 33 34 35 0 0 0 43 44 45 46 0 0 0 54 55 56 0 0 0 0 65 66 then N = 6, ML = 1, MU = 2, LDA .GE. 5 and ABE should contain * 11 12 13 + , * = not used 21 22 23 24 + , + = used for pivoting 32 33 34 35 + 43 44 45 46 + 54 55 56 * + 65 66 * * +

## Interface documentation quality

- Evidence level: `argument_contract_incomplete`
- Description provenance: `source_prologue`
- Assessment: the routine description and ABI rows are complete, but at least one argument lacks separable semantic evidence
- Dedicated family page: [Dense linear algebra](../families/dense-linear-algebra.md)

The table reports compiler/interface facts separately from source-prologue semantics. Unknown intent, aliasing, workspace, leading-dimension, and retention rules remain explicit; parameter names alone are never treated as semantic evidence. Native code does not retain ordinary argument pointers unless a reviewed declaration explicitly says otherwise.

### ABI and safety

Canonical path: `slatec_sys::linear_algebra::banded::snbfa`. Native symbol: `snbfa_`. Feature: `linear-algebra`. Provider status: `selected_provider_verified`. ABI fingerprint: `subroutine:void(mut_f32_ptr_rank2,mut_i32,mut_i32,mut_i32,mut_i32,mut_i32_ptr_rank1,mut_i32)`. Every pointer must be aligned and valid for the full source-defined readable or writable extent; callers must uphold array dimensions, leading dimensions, workspace formulas, aliasing restrictions, callback lifetimes, and process-global runtime serialization.
