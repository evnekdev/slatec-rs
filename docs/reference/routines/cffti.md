# CFFTI

[Family: FFTPACK transforms](../families/fftpack-transforms.md) | [All families](../routines-by-family.md) | [Alphabetical index](../routines-alphabetical.md) | [Coverage](../routine-coverage.md)

## Purpose

Initialize a work array for CFFTF and CFFTB.

## Description

******************************************************************** * NOTICE NOTICE NOTICE NOTICE NOTICE NOTICE NOTICE * ******************************************************************** * * * This routine uses non-standard Fortran 77 constructs and will * * be removed from the library at a future date. You are * * requested to use CFFTI1. * * * ******************************************************************** Subroutine CFFTI initializes the array WSAVE which is used in both CFFTF and CFFTB. The prime factorization of N together with a tabulation of the trigonometric functions are computed and stored in WSAVE. Input Parameter N the length of the sequence to be transformed Output Parameter WSAVE a work array which must be dimensioned at least 4*N+15. The same work array can be used for both CFFTF and CFFTB as long as N remains unchanged. Different WSAVE arrays are required for different values of N. The contents of WSAVE must not be changed between calls of CFFTF or CFFTB.

### Arguments

| Argument | Direction | Fortran type | Rust raw type | Shape | Description | Relationships and requirements | Nullable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `N` | input | `INTEGER` (`implicit_rule`) | `*mut crate::FortranInteger` | scalar | The prime factorization of N together with a tabulation of the trigonometric functions are computed and stored in WSAVE. | none stated in the separable source sentence Leading dimension: not established Workspace: not established | required; null is not permitted for an ordinary Fortran actual argument |
| `WSAVE` | output | `REAL` (`implicit_rule`) | `*mut f32` | rank 1; dimensions (*) | * * * ******************************************************************** Subroutine CFFTI initializes the array WSAVE which is used in both CFFTF and CFFTB. | none stated in the separable source sentence Leading dimension: not established Workspace: not established | required; null is not permitted for an ordinary Fortran actual argument |

The table reports compiler/interface facts separately from source-prologue semantics. Unknown intent, aliasing, workspace, leading-dimension, and retention rules remain explicit; parameter names alone are never treated as semantic evidence. Native code does not retain ordinary argument pointers unless a reviewed declaration explicitly says otherwise.
