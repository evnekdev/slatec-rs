## Purpose

Accumulate orthogonal similarity transformations in the reduction of real general matrix by ORTHES.

## Description

This subroutine is a translation of the ALGOL procedure ORTRANS, NUM. MATH. 16, 181-204(1970) by Peters and Wilkinson. HANDBOOK FOR AUTO. COMP., VOL.II-LINEAR ALGEBRA, 372-395(1971). This subroutine accumulates the orthogonal similarity transformations used in the reduction of a REAL GENERAL matrix to upper Hessenberg form by ORTHES. On INPUT NM must be set to the row dimension of the two-dimensional array parameters, A and Z, as declared in the calling program dimension statement. NM is an INTEGER variable. N is the order of the matrix A. N is an INTEGER variable. N must be less than or equal to NM. LOW and IGH are two INTEGER variables determined by the balancing subroutine BALANC. If BALANC has not been used, set LOW=1 and IGH equal to the order of the matrix, N. A contains some information about the orthogonal transformations used in the reduction to Hessenberg form by ORTHES in its strict lower triangle. A is a two-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned A(NM,IGH). ORT contains further information about the orthogonal transformations used in the reduction by ORTHES. Only elements LOW through IGH are used. ORT is a one-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned ORT(IGH). On OUTPUT Z contains the transformation matrix produced in the reduction by ORTHES to the upper Hessenberg form. Z is a twodimensional REAL array, dimensioned Z(NM,N). ORT has been used for temporary storage as is not restored. Questions and comments should be directed to B. S. Garbow, APPLIED MATHEMATICS DIVISION, ARGONNE NATIONAL LABORATORY

## Interface documentation quality

- Evidence level: `argument_contract_incomplete`
- Description provenance: `source_prologue`
- Assessment: the routine description and ABI rows are complete, but at least one argument lacks separable semantic evidence
- Dedicated family page: [Eigenvalue problems](../families/eigenvalue-problems.md)

The table reports compiler/interface facts separately from source-prologue semantics. Unknown intent, aliasing, workspace, leading-dimension, and retention rules remain explicit; parameter names alone are never treated as semantic evidence. Native code does not retain ordinary argument pointers unless a reviewed declaration explicitly says otherwise.

### ABI and safety

Canonical path: `slatec_sys::linear_algebra::eigen::ortran`. Native symbol: `ortran_`. Feature: `eigen`. Provider status: `selected_provider_verified`. ABI fingerprint: `subroutine:void(mut_i32,mut_i32,mut_i32,mut_i32,mut_f32_ptr_rank2,mut_f32_ptr_rank1,mut_f32_ptr_rank2)`. Every pointer must be aligned and valid for the full source-defined readable or writable extent; callers must uphold array dimensions, leading dimensions, workspace formulas, aliasing restrictions, callback lifetimes, and process-global runtime serialization.
