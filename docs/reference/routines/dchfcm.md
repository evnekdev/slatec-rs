# DCHFCM

## Purpose

Check a single cubic for monotonicity.

## Description

*Usage: DOUBLE PRECISION D1, D2, DELTA INTEGER ISMON, DCHFCM ISMON = DCHFCM (D1, D2, DELTA) *Arguments: D1,D2:IN are the derivative values at the ends of an interval. DELTA:IN is the data slope over that interval. *Function Return Values: ISMON : indicates the monotonicity of the cubic segment: ISMON = -3 if function is probably decreasing; ISMON = -1 if function is strictly decreasing; ISMON = 0 if function is constant; ISMON = 1 if function is strictly increasing; ISMON = 2 if function is non-monotonic; ISMON = 3 if function is probably increasing. If ABS(ISMON)=3, the derivative values are too close to the boundary of the monotonicity region to declare monotonicity in the presence of roundoff error. *Description: DCHFCM: Cubic Hermite Function -- Check Monotonicity. Called by DPCHCM to determine the monotonicity properties of the cubic with boundary derivative values D1,D2 and chord slope DELTA. *Cautions: This is essentially the same as old DCHFMC, except that a new output value, -3, was added February 1989. (Formerly, -3 and +3 were lumped together in the single value 3.) Codes that flag nonmonotonicity by "IF (ISMON.EQ.2)" need not be changed. Codes that check via "IF (ISMON.GE.3)" should change the test to "IF (IABS(ISMON).GE.3)". Codes that declare monotonicity via "IF (ISMON.LE.1)" should change to "IF (IABS(ISMON).LE.1)".
