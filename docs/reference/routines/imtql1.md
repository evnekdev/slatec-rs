## Purpose

Compute the eigenvalues of a symmetric tridiagonal matrix using the implicit QL method.

## Description

This subroutine is a translation of the ALGOL procedure IMTQL1, NUM. MATH. 12, 377-383(1968) by Martin and Wilkinson, as modified in NUM. MATH. 15, 450(1970) by Dubrulle. HANDBOOK FOR AUTO. COMP., VOL.II-LINEAR ALGEBRA, 241-248(1971). This subroutine finds the eigenvalues of a SYMMETRIC TRIDIAGONAL matrix by the implicit QL method. On INPUT N is the order of the matrix. N is an INTEGER variable. D contains the diagonal elements of the symmetric tridiagonal matrix. D is a one-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned D(N). E contains the subdiagonal elements of the symmetric tridiagonal matrix in its last N-1 positions. E(1) is arbitrary. E is a one-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned E(N). On OUTPUT

### Arguments

| # | Argument | Direction | Role | Fortran type | Rust raw type | Shape | Contract |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `N` | `input` | `scalar` | `INTEGER` | `*mut crate::FortranInteger` | scalar | Scalar argument classified by fixed-form executable read/write analysis. |
| 2 | `D` | `input-output` | `array` | `REAL` | `*mut f32` | rank 1; dimensions (*) | Array argument classified by fixed-form executable read/write analysis. |
| 3 | `E` | `input-output` | `array` | `REAL` | `*mut f32` | rank 1; dimensions (*) | Array argument classified by fixed-form executable read/write analysis. |
| 4 | `IERR` | `output` | `scalar` | `INTEGER` | `*mut crate::FortranInteger` | scalar | Scalar argument classified by fixed-form executable read/write analysis. |

Argument evidence records nullability, shape, relationships, leading dimensions, workspace rules, options, and overwrite behavior in the authoritative public-documentation inventory. Native code does not retain ordinary argument pointers.

### Return value

This is a Fortran subroutine and has no direct return value; outputs are documented in its argument contract.

### Callback contract

This interface declares no callback argument.

### Error and status values

exit is made, the eigenvalues are correct and ordered for indices 1, 2, ..., IERR-1, but may not be the smallest eigenvalues. E has been destroyed. IERR is an INTEGER flag set to Zero       for normal return, J          if the J-th eigenvalue has not been determined after 30 iterations. The eigenvalues should be correct for indices 1, 2, ..., IERR-1.  These eigenvalues are ordered, but are not necessarily the smallest. Calls PYTHAG(A,B) for sqrt(A**2 + B**2). Questions and comments should be directed to B. S. Garbow, APPLIED MATHEMATICS DIVISION, ARGONNE NATIONAL LABORATORY ------------------------------------------------------------------

### Storage and workspace requirements

This interface declares no separately named workspace argument. Array storage, if any, is Fortran column-major and must satisfy the documented shape and leading-dimension relationships.

### Provider, ABI, and safety

Canonical Rust path: `slatec_sys::linear_algebra::eigen::imtql1`. Native symbol: `imtql1_`. Declaration feature: `eigen`. Provider feature: `linear-algebra-eigen`. ABI fingerprint: `subroutine:void(mut_i32,mut_f32_ptr_rank1,mut_f32_ptr_rank1,mut_i32)`.

# Safety

Every pointer must be non-null unless its argument record explicitly permits null, correctly aligned, and valid for its documented readable or writable extent. Callers must preserve Fortran column-major layout, dimensions, leading dimensions, workspace capacity, callback lifetime, and the selected provider's runtime serialization requirements. Mutable arguments may not alias in a way the native routine does not permit.
