## Purpose

The routine calculates an approximation result to a Cauchy principal value I = INTEGRAL of F*W over (A,B) (W(X) = 1/((X-C), C.NE.A, C.NE.B), hopefully satisfying following claim for accuracy ABS(I-RESULT).LE.MAX(EPSABE,EPSREL*ABS(I)).

## Description

Computation of a Cauchy principal value Standard fortran subroutine Double precision version PARAMETERS ON ENTRY F - Double precision Function subprogram defining the integrand Function F(X). The actual name for F needs to be declared E X T E R N A L in the driver program. A - Double precision Under limit of integration B - Double precision Upper limit of integration C - Parameter in the weight function, C.NE.A, C.NE.B. If C = A or C = B, the routine will end with IER = 6 . EPSABS - Double precision Absolute accuracy requested EPSREL - Double precision Relative accuracy requested If EPSABS.LE.0 and EPSREL.LT.MAX(50*REL.MACH.ACC.,0.5D-28), the routine will end with IER = 6. ON RETURN RESULT - Double precision Approximation to the integral ABSERR - Double precision Estimate or the modulus of the absolute error, Which should equal or exceed ABS(I-RESULT) NEVAL - Integer Number of integrand evaluations IER - Integer IER = 0 Normal and reliable termination of the routine. It is assumed that the requested accuracy has been achieved. IER.GT.0 Abnormal termination of the routine the estimates for integral and error are less reliable. It is assumed that the requested accuracy has not been achieved. ERROR MESSAGES IER = 1 Maximum number of subdivisions allowed has been achieved. One can allow more subdivisions by increasing the value of LIMIT (and taking the according dimension adjustments into account). However, if this yields no improvement it is advised to analyze the integrand in order to determine the integration difficulties. If the position of a local difficulty can be determined (e.g. SINGULARITY, DISCONTINUITY within the interval) one will probably gain from splitting up the interval at this point and calling appropriate integrators on the subranges. = 2 The occurrence of roundoff error is detected, which prevents the requested tolerance from being achieved. = 3 Extremely bad integrand behaviour occurs at some points of the integration interval. = 6 The input is invalid, because C = A or C = B or (EPSABS.LE.0 and EPSREL.LT.MAX(50*REL.MACH.ACC.,0.5D-28)) or LIMIT.LT.1 or LENW.LT.LIMIT*4. RESULT, ABSERR, NEVAL, LAST are set to zero. Except when LENW or LIMIT is invalid, IWORK(1), WORK(LIMIT*2+1) and WORK(LIMIT*3+1) are set to zero, WORK(1) is set to A and WORK(LIMIT+1) to B. DIMENSIONING PARAMETERS LIMIT - Integer Dimensioning parameter for IWORK LIMIT determines the maximum number of subintervals in the partition of the given integration interval (A,B), LIMIT.GE.1. If LIMIT.LT.1, the routine will end with IER = 6. LENW - Integer Dimensioning parameter for WORK LENW must be at least LIMIT*4. If LENW.LT.LIMIT*4, the routine will end with IER = 6. LAST - Integer On return, LAST equals the number of subintervals produced in the subdivision process, which determines the number of significant elements actually in the WORK ARRAYS. WORK ARRAYS IWORK - Integer Vector of dimension at least LIMIT, the first K elements of which contain pointers to the error estimates over the subintervals, such that WORK(LIMIT*3+IWORK(1)), ... , WORK(LIMIT*3+IWORK(K)) form a decreasing sequence, with K = LAST if LAST.LE.(LIMIT/2+2), and K = LIMIT+1-LAST otherwise WORK - Double precision Vector of dimension at least LENW On return WORK(1), ..., WORK(LAST) contain the left
