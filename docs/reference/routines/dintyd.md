## Purpose

Subsidiary to DDEBDF

## Description

DINTYD approximates the solution and derivatives at T by polynomial interpolation. Must be used in conjunction with the integrator package DDEBDF. DINTYD computes interpolated values of the K-th derivative of the dependent variable vector Y, and stores it in DKY. This routine is called by DDEBDF with K = 0,1 and T = TOUT, but may also be called by the user for any K up to the current order. (see detailed instructions in LSODE usage documentation.) The computed values in DKY are gotten by interpolation using the Nordsieck history array YH. This array corresponds uniquely to a vector-valued polynomial of degree NQCUR or less, and DKY is set to the K-th derivative of this polynomial at T. The formula for DKY is.. Q DKY(I) = Sum C(J,K) * (T - TN)**(J-K) * H**(-J) * YH(I,J+1) J=K where C(J,K) = J*(J-1)*...*(J-K+1), Q = NQCUR, TN = TCUR, H = HCUR. The quantities NQ = NQCUR, L = NQ+1, N = NEQ, TN, and H are communicated by common. The above sum is done in reverse order. IFLAG is returned negative if either K or T is out of bounds.
