## Purpose

SLAP Column Format Sparse Matrix Transpose Vector Product. Routine to calculate the sparse matrix vector product: Y = A'*X, where ' denotes transpose.

## Description

Usage: INTEGER N, NELT, IA(NELT), JA(NELT), ISYM REAL X(N), Y(N), A(NELT) CALL SSMTV(N, X, Y, NELT, IA, JA, A, ISYM ) =================== S L A P Column format ================== This routine requires that the matrix A be stored in the SLAP Column format. In this format the non-zeros are stored counting down columns (except for the diagonal entry, which must appear first in each "column") and are stored in the real array A. In other words, for each column in the matrix put the diagonal entry in A. Then put in the other non-zero elements going down the column (except the diagonal) in order. The IA array holds the row index for each non-zero. The JA array holds the offsets into the IA, A arrays for the beginning of each column. That is, IA(JA(ICOL)), A(JA(ICOL)) points to the beginning of the ICOL-th column in IA and A. IA(JA(ICOL+1)-1), A(JA(ICOL+1)-1) points to the end of the ICOL-th column. Note that we always have

### Arguments

| # | Argument | Direction | Role | Fortran type | Rust raw type | Shape | Contract |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `N` | `input` | `scalar` | `INTEGER` | `*mut crate::FortranInteger` | scalar | Integer. Order of the Matrix. |
| 2 | `X` | `input` | `array` | `REAL` | `*mut f32` | rank 1; dimensions (N) | X(N). The vector that should be multiplied by the transpose of the matrix. |
| 3 | `Y` | `output` | `array` | `REAL` | `*mut f32` | rank 1; dimensions (N) | A'*X, where ' denotes transpose. Y(N). The product of the transpose of the matrix and the vector. |
| 4 | `NELT` | `input` | `scalar` | `INTEGER` | `*mut crate::FortranInteger` | scalar | Integer. Number of Non-Zeros stored in A. |
| 5 | `IA` | `input` | `array` | `INTEGER` | `*mut crate::FortranInteger` | rank 1; dimensions (NELT) | IA(NELT). |
| 6 | `JA` | `input` | `array` | `INTEGER` | `*mut crate::FortranInteger` | rank 1; dimensions (NELT) | JA(NELT). NELT+1, where N is the number of columns in the matrix and NELT is the number of non-zeros in the matrix. Here is an example of the SLAP Column storage format for a 5x5 Matrix (in the A and IA arrays '\|' denotes the end of a column): 5x5 Matrix SLAP Column format for 5x5 matrix on left. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 \|11 12 0 0 15\| A: 11 21 51 \| 22 12 \| 33 53 \| 44 \| 55 15 35 \|21 22 0 0 0\| IA: 1 2 5 \| 2 1 \| 3 5 \| 4 \| 5 1 3 \| 0 0 33 0 35\| JA: 1 4 6 8 9 12 \| 0 0 0 44 0\| \|51 0 53 0 55\| With the SLAP format the "inner loops" of this routine should vectorize on machines with hardware support for vector gather/scatter operations. Your compiler may require. |
| 7 | `A` | `input` | `array` | `REAL` | `*mut f32` | rank 1; dimensions (NELT) | A(NELT). These arrays should hold the matrix A in the SLAP Column format. See "Description", below. compiler directive to convince it that there are no implicit vector dependencies. Compiler directives for the Alliant FX/Fortran and CRI CFT/CFT77 compilers are supplied with the standard SLAP distribution. Cautions: This routine assumes that the matrix A is stored in SLAP Column format. |
| 8 | `ISYM` | `input` | `scalar` | `INTEGER` | `*mut crate::FortranInteger` | scalar | Integer. Flag to indicate symmetric storage format. If ISYM=0, all non-zero entries of the matrix are stored. If ISYM=1, the matrix is symmetric, and only the upper or lower triangle of the matrix is stored. |

The authoritative public-documentation inventory records argument evidence ranges, nullability, shapes, relationships, leading dimensions, option values, and overwrite behavior. Native code does not retain ordinary argument pointers.

### Return value

This is a Fortran subroutine and has no direct return value; outputs are documented in its argument contract.

### Storage and array requirements

Array arguments use Fortran column-major storage and must satisfy their documented shape and leading-dimension relationships.

### Provider, ABI, and safety

Canonical Rust path: `slatec_sys::blas::level1::ssmtv`. Native symbol: `ssmtv_`. Declaration feature: `blas-level1`. Provider feature: `blas-level1`. ABI fingerprint: `unavailable`.

# Safety

Every pointer must be non-null unless its argument record explicitly permits null, correctly aligned, and valid for its documented readable or writable extent. Callers must preserve Fortran column-major layout, dimensions, leading dimensions, workspace capacity, callback lifetime, and the selected provider's runtime serialization requirements. Mutable arguments may not alias in a way the native routine does not permit.
