## Purpose

Reduce a real symmetric matrix to symmetric tridiagonal matrix using orthogonal similarity transformations.

## Description

This subroutine is a translation of the ALGOL procedure TRED1, NUM. MATH. 11, 181-195(1968) by Martin, Reinsch, and Wilkinson. HANDBOOK FOR AUTO. COMP., VOL.II-LINEAR ALGEBRA, 212-226(1971). This subroutine reduces a REAL SYMMETRIC matrix to a symmetric tridiagonal matrix using orthogonal similarity transformations. On Input NM must be set to the row dimension of the two-dimensional array parameter, A, as declared in the calling program dimension statement. NM is an INTEGER variable. N is the order of the matrix A. N is an INTEGER variable. N must be less than or equal to NM. A contains the real symmetric input matrix. Only the lower triangle of the matrix need be supplied. A is a twodimensional REAL array, dimensioned A(NM,N). On Output A contains information about the orthogonal transformations used in the reduction in its strict lower triangle. The full upper triangle of A is unaltered. D contains the diagonal elements of the symmetric tridiagonal matrix. D is a one-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned D(N). E contains the subdiagonal elements of the symmetric tridiagonal matrix in its last N-1 positions. E(1) is set to zero. E is a one-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned E(N). E2 contains the squares of the corresponding elements of E. E2 may coincide with E if the squares are not needed. E2 is a one-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned E2(N).
