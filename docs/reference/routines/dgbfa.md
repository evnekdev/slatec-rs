## Purpose

Factor a band matrix using Gaussian elimination.

## Description

DGBFA factors a double precision band matrix by elimination. DGBFA is usually called by DGBCO, but it can be called directly with a saving in time if RCOND is not needed. On Entry ABD DOUBLE PRECISION(LDA, N) contains the matrix in band storage. The columns of the matrix are stored in the columns of ABD and the diagonals of the matrix are stored in rows ML+1 through 2*ML+MU+1 of ABD . See the comments below for details. LDA INTEGER the leading dimension of the array ABD . LDA must be .GE. 2*ML + MU + 1 . N INTEGER the order of the original matrix. ML INTEGER number of diagonals below the main diagonal. 0 .LE. ML .LT. N . MU INTEGER number of diagonals above the main diagonal. 0 .LE. MU .LT. N . More efficient if ML .LE. MU . On Return ABD an upper triangular matrix in band storage and the multipliers which were used to obtain it. The factorization can be written A = L*U where L is a product of permutation and unit lower triangular matrices and U is upper triangular. IPVT INTEGER(N) an integer vector of pivot indices. INFO INTEGER = 0 normal value. = K if U(K,K) .EQ. 0.0 . This is not an error condition for this subroutine, but it does indicate that DGBSL will divide by zero if called. Use RCOND in DGBCO for a reliable indication of singularity. Band Storage If A is a band matrix, the following program segment will set up the input. ML = (band width below the diagonal) MU = (band width above the diagonal) M = ML + MU + 1 DO 20 J = 1, N I1 = MAX(1, J-MU) I2 = MIN(N, J+ML) DO 10 I = I1, I2 K = I - J + M ABD(K,J) = A(I,J) 10 CONTINUE 20 CONTINUE This uses rows ML+1 through 2*ML+MU+1 of ABD . In addition, the first ML rows in ABD are used for elements generated during the triangularization. The total number of rows needed in ABD is 2*ML+MU+1 . The ML+MU by ML+MU upper left triangle and the ML by ML lower right triangle are not referenced.

The table reports compiler/interface facts separately from source-prologue semantics. Unknown intent, aliasing, workspace, leading-dimension, and retention rules remain explicit; parameter names alone are never treated as semantic evidence. Native code does not retain ordinary argument pointers unless a reviewed declaration explicitly says otherwise.

### ABI and safety

Canonical path: `slatec_sys::linear_algebra::banded::dgbfa`. Native symbol: `dgbfa_`. Feature: `linear-algebra`. Provider status: `selected_provider_verified`. ABI fingerprint: `subroutine:void(mut_f64_ptr_rank2,mut_i32,mut_i32,mut_i32,mut_i32,mut_i32_ptr_rank1,mut_i32)`. Every pointer must be aligned and valid for the full source-defined readable or writable extent; callers must uphold array dimensions, leading dimensions, workspace formulas, aliasing restrictions, callback lifetimes, and process-global runtime serialization.
