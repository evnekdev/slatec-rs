## Purpose

Form the eigenvectors of a real symmetric matrix from the eigenvectors of a symmetric tridiagonal matrix formed by TRED3.

## Description

This subroutine is a translation of the ALGOL procedure TRBAK3, NUM. MATH. 11, 181-195(1968) by Martin, Reinsch, and Wilkinson. HANDBOOK FOR AUTO. COMP., VOL.II-LINEAR ALGEBRA, 212-226(1971). This subroutine forms the eigenvectors of a REAL SYMMETRIC matrix by back transforming those of the corresponding symmetric tridiagonal matrix determined by TRED3. On Input NM must be set to the row dimension of the two-dimensional array parameter, Z, as declared in the calling program dimension statement. NM is an INTEGER variable. N is the order of the matrix. N is an INTEGER variable. N must be less than or equal to NM. NV is an INTEGER variable set equal to the dimension of the array A as specified in the calling program. NV must not be less than N*(N+1)/2. A contains information about the orthogonal transformations used in the reduction by TRED3 in its first N*(N+1)/2 positions. A is a one-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned A(NV). M is the number of columns of Z to be back transformed. M is an INTEGER variable. Z contains the eigenvectors to be back transformed in its first M columns. Z is a two-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned Z(NM,M). On Output Z contains the transformed eigenvectors in its first M columns. Note that TRBAK3 preserves vector Euclidean norms. Questions and comments should be directed to b. s.

### Arguments

| # | Argument | Direction | Role | Fortran type | Rust raw type | Shape | Contract |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `NM` | `input` | `scalar` | `INTEGER` | `*mut crate::FortranInteger` | scalar | Scalar argument classified by fixed-form executable read/write analysis. |
| 2 | `N` | `input` | `scalar` | `INTEGER` | `*mut crate::FortranInteger` | scalar | Scalar argument classified by fixed-form executable read/write analysis. |
| 3 | `NV` | `input` | `scalar` | `INTEGER` | `*mut crate::FortranInteger` | scalar | Scalar argument classified by fixed-form executable read/write analysis. |
| 4 | `A` | `input` | `array` | `REAL` | `*mut f32` | rank 1; dimensions (*) | Array argument classified by fixed-form executable read/write analysis. |
| 5 | `M` | `input` | `scalar` | `INTEGER` | `*mut crate::FortranInteger` | scalar | Scalar argument classified by fixed-form executable read/write analysis. |
| 6 | `Z` | `input-output` | `array` | `REAL` | `*mut f32` | rank 2; dimensions (NM, *) | Array argument classified by fixed-form executable read/write analysis. |

Argument evidence records nullability, shape, relationships, leading dimensions, workspace rules, options, and overwrite behavior in the authoritative public-documentation inventory. Native code does not retain ordinary argument pointers.

### Return value

This is a Fortran subroutine and has no direct return value; outputs are documented in its argument contract.

### Callback contract

This interface declares no callback argument.

### Error and status values

The selected source does not provide a separate error-status section. Any status output argument is identified in the argument table; callers must also respect the legacy SLATEC error-runtime behavior described by the source.

### Storage and workspace requirements

This interface declares no separately named workspace argument. Array storage, if any, is Fortran column-major and must satisfy the documented shape and leading-dimension relationships.

### Provider, ABI, and safety

Canonical Rust path: `slatec_sys::linear_algebra::eigen::trbak3`. Native symbol: `trbak3_`. Declaration feature: `eigen`. Provider feature: `linear-algebra-eigen`. ABI fingerprint: `subroutine:void(mut_i32,mut_i32,mut_i32,mut_f32_ptr_rank1,mut_i32,mut_f32_ptr_rank2)`.

# Safety

Every pointer must be non-null unless its argument record explicitly permits null, correctly aligned, and valid for its documented readable or writable extent. Callers must preserve Fortran column-major layout, dimensions, leading dimensions, workspace capacity, callback lifetime, and the selected provider's runtime serialization requirements. Mutable arguments may not alias in a way the native routine does not permit.
