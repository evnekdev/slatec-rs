## Purpose

Reduce a complex Hermitian matrix to a real symmetric tridiagonal matrix using unitary similarity transformations.

## Description

This subroutine is a translation of a complex analogue of the ALGOL procedure TRED1, NUM. MATH. 11, 181-195(1968) by Martin, Reinsch, and Wilkinson. HANDBOOK FOR AUTO. COMP., VOL.II-LINEAR ALGEBRA, 212-226(1971). This subroutine reduces a COMPLEX HERMITIAN matrix to a real symmetric tridiagonal matrix using unitary similarity transformations. On INPUT NM must be set to the row dimension of the two-dimensional array parameters, AR and AI, as declared in the calling program dimension statement. NM is an INTEGER variable. N is the order of the matrix A=(AR,AI). N is an INTEGER variable. N must be less than or equal to NM. AR and AI contain the real and imaginary parts, respectively, of the complex Hermitian input matrix. Only the lower triangle of the matrix need be supplied. AR and AI are twodimensional REAL arrays, dimensioned AR(NM,N) and AI(NM,N). On OUTPUT AR and AI contain some information about the unitary transformations used in the reduction in the strict lower triangle of AR and the full lower triangle of AI. The rest of the matrices are unaltered. D contains the diagonal elements of the real symmetric tridiagonal matrix. D is a one-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned D(N). E contains the subdiagonal elements of the real tridiagonal matrix in its last N-1 positions. E(1) is set to zero. E is a one-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned E(N). E2 contains the squares of the corresponding elements of E. E2(1) is set to zero. E2 may coincide with E if the squares are not needed. E2 is a one-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned E2(N). TAU contains further information about the transformations. TAU is a one-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned TAU(2,N). Calls PYTHAG(A,B) for sqrt(A**2 + B**2).
