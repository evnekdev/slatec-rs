[Family: Dense linear algebra](../families/dense-linear-algebra.md) | [All families](../routines-by-family.md) | [Alphabetical index](../routines-alphabetical.md) | [Coverage](../routine-coverage.md)

## Purpose

Factor a real symmetric matrix by elimination with symmetric pivoting.

## Description

SSIFA factors a real symmetric matrix by elimination with symmetric pivoting. To solve A*X = B , follow SSIFA by SSISL. To compute INVERSE(A)*C , follow SSIFA by SSISL. To compute DETERMINANT(A) , follow SSIFA by SSIDI. To compute INERTIA(A) , follow SSIFA by SSIDI. To compute INVERSE(A) , follow SSIFA by SSIDI. On Entry

### Arguments

| # | Argument | Direction | Role | Fortran type | Rust raw type | Shape | Contract |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `A` | `input-output` | `array` | `REAL` | `*mut f32` | rank 2; dimensions (LDA, *) | REAL(LDA,N) the symmetric matrix to be factored. Only the diagonal and upper triangle are used. a block diagonal matrix and the multipliers which were used to obtain it. The factorization can be written A = U*D*TRANS(U) where U is a product of permutation and unit upper triangular matrices , TRANS(U) is the transpose of U , and D is block diagonal with 1 by 1 and 2 by 2 blocks. |
| 2 | `LDA` | `input` | `scalar` | `INTEGER` | `*mut crate::FortranInteger` | scalar | INTEGER the leading dimension of the array A. |
| 3 | `N` | `input` | `scalar` | `INTEGER` | `*mut crate::FortranInteger` | scalar | INTEGER the order of the matrix A. |
| 4 | `KPVT` | `output` | `array` | `INTEGER` | `*mut crate::FortranInteger` | rank 1; dimensions (*) | INTEGER(N) an integer vector of pivot indices. |
| 5 | `INFO` | `status-output` | `status` | `INTEGER` | `*mut crate::FortranInteger` | scalar | INTEGER = 0 normal value. = K if the K-th pivot block is singular. This is not an error condition for this subroutine, but it does indicate that SSISL or SSIDI may divide by zero if called. |

The authoritative public-documentation inventory records argument evidence ranges, nullability, shapes, relationships, leading dimensions, option values, and overwrite behavior. Native code does not retain ordinary argument pointers.

### Return value

This is a Fortran subroutine and has no direct return value; outputs are documented in its argument contract.

### Error and status values

| Status | Value | Meaning |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `INFO` | `0` | 0 normal value. = K if the K-th pivot block is singular. This is not an error condition for this subroutine, but it does indicate that SSISL or SSIDI may divide by zero if called. |

### Storage and array requirements

Array arguments use Fortran column-major storage and must satisfy their documented shape and leading-dimension relationships.

### Provider, ABI, and safety

Canonical Rust path: `slatec_sys::linear_algebra::dense::ssifa`. Native symbol: `ssifa_`. Declaration feature: `linear-algebra`. Provider feature: `linear-algebra-real`. ABI fingerprint: `subroutine:void(mut_f32_ptr_rank2,mut_i32,mut_i32,mut_i32_ptr_rank1,mut_i32)`.

# Safety

Every pointer must be non-null unless its argument record explicitly permits null, correctly aligned, and valid for its documented readable or writable extent. Callers must preserve Fortran column-major layout, dimensions, leading dimensions, workspace capacity, callback lifetime, and the selected provider's runtime serialization requirements. Mutable arguments may not alias in a way the native routine does not permit.
