Argument evidence records nullability, shape, relationships, leading dimensions, workspace rules, options, and overwrite behavior in the authoritative public-documentation inventory. Native code does not retain ordinary argument pointers.

### Return value

This is a Fortran subroutine and has no direct return value; outputs are documented in its argument contract.

### Callback contract

Callback arguments must use the exact reviewed callback ABI, remain valid for the entire native call, satisfy their documented storage contract, and never unwind through Fortran.

### Error and status values

which should equal or exceed ABS(I-RESULT) NEVAL  - Integer Number of integrand evaluations IER    - Integer IER = 0 Normal and reliable termination of the routine. It is assumed that the requested accuracy has been achieved. IER.GT.0 Abnormal termination of the routine less reliable. It is assumed that the requested accuracy has not been achieved. = 1 Maximum number of subdivisions allowed has been achieved. One can allow more sub- divisions by increasing the value of LIMIT (and taking the according dimension adjustments into account). However, if this yields no improvement it is advised to analyze the integrand in order to determine the integration difficulties. If the position of a local difficulty can be determined (e.g. singularity, discontinuity within the interval) one will probably gain from splitting up the interval at this point and calling the integrator on the subranges. If possible, an appropriate special-purpose integrator should be used, which is designed for handling the type of difficulty involved. ted, which prevents the requested tolerance from being achieved. = 3 Extremely bad integrand behaviour occurs at some points of the integration interval. = 4 The algorithm does not converge. extrapolation table. It is presumed that the requested tolerance cannot be achieved, and that the returned result is the best which can be obtained. = 5 The integral is probably divergent, or slowly convergent. It must be noted that divergence can occur with any other value of IER. = 6 The input is invalid, because EPSABS.LE.0 and EPSREL.LT.MAX(50*REL.MACH.ACC.,0.5D-28). RESULT, ABSERR, NEVAL, LAST, RLIST(1), IORD(1) and ELIST(1) are set to zero. ALIST(1) and BLIST(1) are set to A and B respectively. ALIST  - Double precision Vector of dimension at least LIMIT, the first LAST  elements of which are the left end points of the subintervals in the partition of the given integration range (A,B) BLIST  - Double precision Vector of dimension at least LIMIT, the first LAST  elements of which are the right end points of the subintervals in the partition of the given integration range (A,B) RLIST  - Double precision Vector of dimension at least LIMIT, the first LAST  elements of which are the integral approximations on the subintervals ELIST  - Double precision Vector of dimension at least LIMIT, the first LAST  elements of which are the moduli of the IORD   - Integer Vector of dimension at least LIMIT, the first K elements of which are pointers to the such that ELIST(IORD(1)), ..., ELIST(IORD(K)) form a decreasing sequence, with K = LAST If LAST.LE.(LIMIT/2+2), and K = LIMIT+1-LAST otherwise LAST   - Integer Number of subintervals actually produced in the subdivision process

### Storage and workspace requirements

This interface declares no separately named workspace argument. Array storage, if any, is Fortran column-major and must satisfy the documented shape and leading-dimension relationships.

### Provider, ABI, and safety

Canonical Rust path: `slatec_sys::quadrature::callbacks::dqagse`. Native symbol: `dqagse_`. Declaration feature: `quadrature-callbacks`. Provider feature: `quadrature`. ABI fingerprint: `subroutine:void(fn:f64(ref_f64),mut_f64,mut_f64,mut_f64,mut_f64,mut_i32,mut_f64,mut_f64,mut_i32,mut_i32,mut_f64_ptr_rank1,mut_f64_ptr_rank1,mut_f64_ptr_rank1,mut_f64_ptr_rank1,mut_i32_ptr_rank1,mut_i32)`.

# Safety

Every pointer must be non-null unless its argument record explicitly permits null, correctly aligned, and valid for its documented readable or writable extent. Callers must preserve Fortran column-major layout, dimensions, leading dimensions, workspace capacity, callback lifetime, and the selected provider's runtime serialization requirements. Mutable arguments may not alias in a way the native routine does not permit.
