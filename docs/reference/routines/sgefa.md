## Purpose

Factor a matrix using Gaussian elimination.

## Description

SGEFA factors a real matrix by Gaussian elimination. SGEFA is usually called by SGECO, but it can be called directly with a saving in time if RCOND is not needed. (Time for SGECO) = (1 + 9/N)*(Time for SGEFA) . On Entry A REAL(LDA, N) the matrix to be factored. LDA INTEGER the leading dimension of the array A . N INTEGER the order of the matrix A . On Return A an upper triangular matrix and the multipliers which were used to obtain it. The factorization can be written A = L*U , where L is a product of permutation and unit lower triangular matrices and U is upper triangular. IPVT INTEGER(N) an integer vector of pivot indices. INFO INTEGER = 0 normal value. = K if U(K,K) .EQ. 0.0 . This is not an error condition for this subroutine, but it does indicate that SGESL or SGEDI will divide by zero if called. Use RCOND in SGECO for a reliable indication of singularity.
