## Purpose

Compute the eigenvalues and, optionally, the eigenvectors of a real symmetric matrix.

## Description

This subroutine calls the recommended sequence of subroutines from the eigensystem subroutine package (EISPACK) to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors (if desired) of a REAL SYMMETRIC matrix. On Input NM must be set to the row dimension of the two-dimensional array parameters, A and Z, as declared in the calling program dimension statement. NM is an INTEGER variable. N is the order of the matrix A. N is an INTEGER variable. N must be less than or equal to NM. A contains the real symmetric matrix. A is a two-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned A(NM,N). MATZ is an INTEGER variable set equal to zero if only eigenvalues are desired. Otherwise, it is set to any non-zero integer for both eigenvalues and eigenvectors. On Output A is unaltered. W contains the eigenvalues in ascending order. W is a onedimensional REAL array, dimensioned W(N). Z contains the eigenvectors if MATZ is not zero. The eigenvectors are orthonormal. Z is a two-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned Z(NM,N). IERR is an INTEGER flag set to Zero for normal return, 10*N if N is greater than NM, J if the J-th eigenvalue has not been determined after 30 iterations. The eigenvalues, and eigenvectors if requested, should be correct for indices 1, 2, ..., IERR-1. FV1 and FV2 are one-dimensional REAL arrays used for temporary storage, dimensioned FV1(N) and FV2(N).
