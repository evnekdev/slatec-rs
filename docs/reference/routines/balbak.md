[Family: Eigenvalue problems](../families/eigenvalue-problems.md) | [All families](../routines-by-family.md) | [Alphabetical index](../routines-alphabetical.md) | [Coverage](../routine-coverage.md)

## Purpose

Form the eigenvectors of a real general matrix from the eigenvectors of matrix output from BALANC.

## Description

This subroutine is a translation of the ALGOL procedure BALBAK, NUM. MATH. 13, 293-304(1969) by Parlett and Reinsch. HANDBOOK FOR AUTO. COMP., Vol.II-LINEAR ALGEBRA, 315-326(1971). This subroutine forms the eigenvectors of a REAL GENERAL matrix by back transforming those of the corresponding balanced matrix determined by BALANC.

### Arguments

| # | Argument | Direction | Role | Fortran type | Rust raw type | Shape | Contract |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `NM` | `input` | `scalar` | `INTEGER` | `*mut crate::FortranInteger` | scalar | must be set to the row dimension of the two-dimensional array parameter, Z, as declared in the calling program dimension statement. NM is an INTEGER variable. |
| 2 | `N` | `input` | `scalar` | `INTEGER` | `*mut crate::FortranInteger` | scalar | is the number of components of the vectors in matrix Z. is an INTEGER variable. N must be less than or equal to NM. |
| 3 | `LOW` | `input` | `scalar` | `INTEGER` | `*mut crate::FortranInteger` | scalar | INTEGER variables determined by BALANC. |
| 4 | `IGH` | `input` | `scalar` | `INTEGER` | `*mut crate::FortranInteger` | scalar | INTEGER variables determined by BALANC. |
| 5 | `SCALE` | `input` | `array` | `REAL` | `*mut f32` | rank 1; dimensions (*) | contains information determining the permutations and scaling factors used by BALANC. SCALE is a one-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned SCALE(N). |
| 6 | `M` | `input` | `scalar` | `INTEGER` | `*mut crate::FortranInteger` | scalar | is the number of columns of Z to be back transformed. is an INTEGER variable. |
| 7 | `Z` | `input-output` | `array` | `REAL` | `*mut f32` | rank 2; dimensions (NM, *) | contains the real and imaginary parts of the eigen- vectors to be back transformed in its first M columns. is a two-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned Z(NM,M). transformed eigenvectors in its first M columns.

The authoritative public-documentation inventory records argument evidence ranges, nullability, shapes, relationships, leading dimensions, option values, and overwrite behavior. Native code does not retain ordinary argument pointers.

### Return value

This is a Fortran subroutine and has no direct return value; outputs are documented in its argument contract.

### Storage and array requirements

Array arguments use Fortran column-major storage and must satisfy their documented shape and leading-dimension relationships.

### Provider, ABI, and safety

Canonical Rust path: `slatec_sys::linear_algebra::eigen::balbak`. Native symbol: `balbak_`. Declaration feature: `eigen`. Provider feature: `linear-algebra-eigen`. ABI fingerprint: `subroutine:void(mut_i32,mut_i32,mut_i32,mut_i32,mut_f32_ptr_rank1,mut_i32,mut_f32_ptr_rank2)`.

# Safety

Every pointer must be non-null unless its argument record explicitly permits null, correctly aligned, and valid for its documented readable or writable extent. Callers must preserve Fortran column-major layout, dimensions, leading dimensions, workspace capacity, callback lifetime, and the selected provider's runtime serialization requirements. Mutable arguments may not alias in a way the native routine does not permit.
