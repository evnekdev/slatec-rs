# CTPSV

[Family: Linear algebra kernels](../families/linear-algebra-kernels.md) | [All families](../routines-by-family.md) | [Alphabetical index](../routines-alphabetical.md) | [Coverage](../routine-coverage.md)

## Purpose

Solve one of the systems of equations.

## Description

CTPSV solves one of the systems of equations A*x = b, or A'*x = b, or conjg( A')*x = b, where b and x are n element vectors and A is an n by n unit, or non-unit, upper or lower triangular matrix, supplied in packed form. No test for singularity or near-singularity is included in this routine. Such tests must be performed before calling this routine.

### Arguments

| # | Argument | Direction | Role | Fortran type | Rust raw type | Shape | Contract |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `UPLO` | `input` | `scalar` | `CHARACTER` | `*mut core::ffi::c_char` | scalar | CHARACTER*1. On entry, UPLO specifies whether the matrix is an upper or lower triangular matrix as follows: 'U' or 'u' A is an upper triangular matrix. 'L' or 'l' A is a lower triangular matrix. Unchanged on exit. |
| 2 | `TRANS` | `input` | `scalar` | `CHARACTER` | `*mut core::ffi::c_char` | scalar | CHARACTER*1. On entry, TRANS specifies the equations to be solved as follows: 'N' or 'n' A*x = b. 'T' or 't' A'*x = b. 'C' or 'c' conjg( A' )*x = b. Unchanged on exit. |
| 3 | `DIAG` | `input` | `scalar` | `CHARACTER` | `*mut core::ffi::c_char` | scalar | CHARACTER*1. On entry, DIAG specifies whether or not A is unit triangular as follows: 'U' or 'u' A is assumed to be unit triangular. 'N' or 'n' A is not assumed to be unit Unchanged on exit. |
| 4 | `N` | `input` | `scalar` | `INTEGER` | `*mut crate::FortranInteger` | scalar | INTEGER. On entry, N specifies the order of the matrix A. must be at least zero. Unchanged on exit. |
| 5 | `AP` | `input` | `array` | `COMPLEX` | `*mut crate::Complex32` | rank 1; dimensions (*) | COMPLEX array of DIMENSION at least ( ( n*( n + 1 ) )/2 ). Before entry with UPLO = 'U' or 'u', the array AP must contain the upper triangular matrix packed sequentially, column by column, so that AP( 1 ) contains a( 1, 1 ), AP( 2 ) and AP( 3 ) contain a( 1, 2 ) and a( 2, 2 ) respectively, and so on. Before entry with UPLO = 'L' or 'l', the array AP must contain the lower triangular matrix packed sequentially, AP( 2 ) and AP( 3 ) contain a( 2, 1 ) and a( 3, 1 ) Note that when DIAG = 'U' or 'u', the diagonal elements of A are not referenced, but are assumed to be unity. Unchanged on exit. |
| 6 | `X` | `input-output` | `array` | `COMPLEX` | `*mut crate::Complex32` | rank 1; dimensions (*) | COMPLEX array of dimension at least ( 1 + ( n - 1 )*abs( INCX ) ). Before entry, the incremented array X must contain the n element right-hand side vector b. On exit, X is overwritten with the solution vector x. |
| 7 | `INCX` | `input` | `scalar` | `INTEGER` | `*mut crate::FortranInteger` | scalar | INTEGER. On entry, INCX specifies the increment for the elements of X. INCX must not be zero. Unchanged on exit. |

The authoritative public-documentation inventory records argument evidence ranges, nullability, shapes, relationships, leading dimensions, option values, and overwrite behavior. Native code does not retain ordinary argument pointers.

### Return value

This is a Fortran subroutine and has no direct return value; outputs are documented in its argument contract.

### Storage and array requirements

Array arguments use Fortran column-major storage and must satisfy their documented shape and leading-dimension relationships.

### Provider, ABI, and safety

Canonical Rust path: `slatec_sys::blas::level2::ctpsv`. Native symbol: `ctpsv_`. Declaration feature: `blas-level2`. Provider feature: `blas-level2`. ABI fingerprint: `unavailable`.

# Safety

Every pointer must be non-null unless its argument record explicitly permits null, correctly aligned, and valid for its documented readable or writable extent. Callers must preserve Fortran column-major layout, dimensions, leading dimensions, workspace capacity, callback lifetime, and the selected provider's runtime serialization requirements. Mutable arguments may not alias in a way the native routine does not permit.
