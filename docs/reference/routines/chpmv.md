# CHPMV

[Back to family index](../routines-by-family.md) · [Alphabetical index](../routines-alphabetical.md) · [Coverage](../routine-coverage.md)

## Purpose

Perform the matrix-vector operation.

## Description

CHPMV performs the matrix-vector operation y := alpha*A*x + beta*y, where alpha and beta are scalars, x and y are n element vectors and A is an n by n hermitian matrix, supplied in packed form. Parameters UPLO - CHARACTER*1. On entry, UPLO specifies whether the upper or lower triangular part of the matrix A is supplied in the packed array AP as follows: UPLO = 'U' or 'u' The upper triangular part of A is supplied in AP. UPLO = 'L' or 'l' The lower triangular part of A is supplied in AP. Unchanged on exit. N - INTEGER. On entry, N specifies the order of the matrix A. N must be at least zero. Unchanged on exit. ALPHA - COMPLEX . On entry, ALPHA specifies the scalar alpha. Unchanged on exit. AP - COMPLEX array of DIMENSION at least ( ( n*( n + 1))/2). Before entry with UPLO = 'U' or 'u', the array AP must contain the upper triangular part of the hermitian matrix packed sequentially, column by column, so that AP( 1 ) contains a( 1, 1 ), AP( 2 ) and AP( 3 ) contain a( 1, 2 ) and a( 2, 2 ) respectively, and so on. Before entry with UPLO = 'L' or 'l', the array AP must contain the lower triangular part of the hermitian matrix packed sequentially, column by column, so that AP( 1 ) contains a( 1, 1 ), AP( 2 ) and AP( 3 ) contain a( 2, 1 ) and a( 3, 1 ) respectively, and so on. Note that the imaginary parts of the diagonal elements need not be set and are assumed to be zero. Unchanged on exit. X - COMPLEX array of dimension at least ( 1 + ( n - 1 )*abs( INCX ) ). Before entry, the incremented array X must contain the n element vector x. Unchanged on exit. INCX - INTEGER. On entry, INCX specifies the increment for the elements of X. INCX must not be zero. Unchanged on exit. BETA - COMPLEX . On entry, BETA specifies the scalar beta. When BETA is supplied as zero then Y need not be set on input. Unchanged on exit. Y - COMPLEX array of dimension at least ( 1 + ( n - 1 )*abs( INCY ) ). Before entry, the incremented array Y must contain the n element vector y. On exit, Y is overwritten by the updated vector y. INCY - INTEGER. On entry, INCY specifies the increment for the elements of Y. INCY must not be zero. Unchanged on exit.
