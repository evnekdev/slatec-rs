# CPOFA

[Back to family index](../routines-by-family.md) · [Alphabetical index](../routines-alphabetical.md) · [Coverage](../routine-coverage.md)

## Purpose

Factor a complex Hermitian positive definite matrix.

## Description

CPOFA factors a complex Hermitian positive definite matrix. CPOFA is usually called by CPOCO, but it can be called directly with a saving in time if RCOND is not needed. (Time for CPOCO) = (1 + 18/N)*(Time for CPOFA) . On Entry A COMPLEX(LDA, N) the Hermitian matrix to be factored. Only the diagonal and upper triangle are used. LDA INTEGER the leading dimension of the array A . N INTEGER the order of the matrix A . On Return A an upper triangular matrix R so that A = CTRANS(R)*R where CTRANS(R) is the conjugate transpose. The strict lower triangle is unaltered. If INFO .NE. 0 , the factorization is not complete. INFO INTEGER = 0 for normal return. = K signals an error condition. The leading minor of order K is not positive definite.
