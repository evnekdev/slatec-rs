## Purpose

Incompl. Cholesky Decomposition Preconditioner SLAP Set Up. Routine to generate the Incomplete Cholesky decomposition, L*D*L-trans, of a symmetric positive definite matrix, A, which is stored in SLAP Column format. The unit lower triangular matrix L is stored by rows, and the inverse of the diagonal matrix D is stored.

## Description

*Usage: INTEGER N, NELT, IA(NELT), JA(NELT), ISYM INTEGER NEL, IEL(NEL), JEL(NEL), IWARN DOUBLE PRECISION A(NELT), EL(NEL), D(N), R(N) CALL DSICS( N, NELT, IA, JA, A, ISYM, NEL, IEL, JEL, EL, D, R, $ IWARN ) *Arguments: N :IN Integer. Order of the Matrix. NELT :IN Integer. Number of elements in arrays IA, JA, and A. IA :INOUT Integer IA(NELT). JA :INOUT Integer JA(NELT). A :INOUT Double Precision A(NELT). These arrays should hold the matrix A in the SLAP Column format. See "Description", below. ISYM :IN Integer. Flag to indicate symmetric storage format. If ISYM=0, all non-zero entries of the matrix are stored. If ISYM=1, the matrix is symmetric, and only the lower triangle of the matrix is stored. NEL :OUT Integer. Number of non-zeros in the lower triangle of A. Also corresponds to the length of the IEL, JEL, EL arrays. IEL :OUT Integer IEL(NEL). JEL :OUT Integer JEL(NEL). EL :OUT Double Precision EL(NEL). IEL, JEL, EL contain the unit lower triangular factor of the incomplete decomposition of the A matrix stored in SLAP Row format. The Diagonal of ones *IS* stored. See "Description", below for more details about the SLAP Row fmt. D :OUT Double Precision D(N) Upon return this array holds D(I) = 1./DIAG(A). R :WORK Double Precision R(N). Temporary double precision workspace needed for the factorization. IWARN :OUT Integer. This is a warning variable and is zero if the IC factorization goes well. It is set to the row index corresponding to the last zero pivot found. See "Description", below. *Description =================== S L A P Column format ================== This routine requires that the matrix A be stored in the SLAP Column format. In this format the non-zeros are stored counting down columns (except for the diagonal entry, which must appear first in each "column") and are stored in the double precision array A. In other words, for each column in the matrix put the diagonal entry in A. Then put in the other non-zero elements going down the column (except the diagonal) in order. The IA array holds the row index for each non-zero. The JA array holds the offsets into the IA, A arrays for the beginning of each column. That is, IA(JA(ICOL)), A(JA(ICOL)) points to the beginning of the ICOL-th column in IA and A. IA(JA(ICOL+1)-1), A(JA(ICOL+1)-1) points to the end of the ICOL-th column. Note that we always have JA(N+1) = NELT+1, where N is the number of columns in the matrix and NELT is the number of non-zeros in the matrix. Here is an example of the SLAP Column storage format for a 5x5 Matrix (in the A and IA arrays '|' denotes the end of a column): 5x5 Matrix SLAP Column format for 5x5 matrix on left. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 |11 12 0 0 15| A: 11 21 51 | 22 12 | 33 53 | 44 | 55 15 35 |21 22 0 0 0| IA: 1 2 5 | 2 1 | 3 5 | 4 | 5 1 3 | 0 0 33 0 35| JA: 1 4 6 8 9 12 | 0 0 0 44 0| |51 0 53 0 55| ==================== S L A P Row format ==================== This routine requires that the matrix A be stored in the SLAP Row format. In this format the non-zeros are stored counting across rows (except for the diagonal entry, which must appear first in each "row") and are stored in the double precision array A. In other words, for each row in the matrix put the diagonal entry in A. Then put in the other non-zero elements going across the row (except the diagonal) in order. The JA array holds the column index for each non-zero. The IA array holds the offsets into the JA, A arrays for the beginning of each row. That is, JA(IA(IROW)),A(IA(IROW)) are the first elements of the IROWth row in JA and A, and JA(IA(IROW+1)-1), A(IA(IROW+1)-1) are the last elements of the IROW-th row. Note that we always have IA(N+1) = NELT+1, where N is the number of rows in the matrix and NELT is the number of non-zeros in the matrix. Here is an example of the SLAP Row storage format for a 5x5 Matrix (in the A and JA arrays '|' denotes the end of a row): 5x5 Matrix SLAP Row format for 5x5 matrix on left. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 |11 12 0 0 15| A: 11 12 15 | 22 21 | 33 35 | 44 | 55 51 53 |21 22 0 0 0| JA: 1 2 5 | 2 1 | 3 5 | 4 | 5 1 3 | 0 0 33 0 35| IA: 1 4 6 8 9 12 | 0 0 0 44 0| |51 0 53 0 55| With the SLAP format some of the "inner loops" of this routine should vectorize on machines with hardware support for vector gather/scatter operations. Your compiler may require a compiler directive to convince it that there are no implicit vector dependencies. Compiler directives for the Alliant FX/Fortran and CRI CFT/CFT77 compilers are supplied with the standard SLAP distribution. The IC factorization does not always exist for SPD matrices. In the event that a zero pivot is found it is set to be 1.0 and the factorization proceeds. The integer variable IWARN is set to the last row where the Diagonal was fudged. This eventuality hardly ever occurs in practice.
