The table reports compiler/interface facts separately from source-prologue semantics. Unknown intent, aliasing, workspace, leading-dimension, and retention rules remain explicit; parameter names alone are never treated as semantic evidence. Native code does not retain ordinary argument pointers unless a reviewed declaration explicitly says otherwise.

### Return value

The Fortran function returns `*mut f64` through the compiler-validated ABI recorded by the authoritative declaration fingerprint `not_publicly_owned`.
