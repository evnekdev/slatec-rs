## Purpose

Reduce a real general matrix to upper Hessenberg form using orthogonal similarity transformations.

## Description

This subroutine is a translation of the ALGOL procedure ORTHES, NUM. MATH. 12, 349-368(1968) by Martin and Wilkinson. HANDBOOK FOR AUTO. COMP., VOL.II-LINEAR ALGEBRA, 339-358(1971). Given a REAL GENERAL matrix, this subroutine reduces a submatrix situated in rows and columns LOW through IGH to upper Hessenberg form by orthogonal similarity transformations.

### Arguments

| # | Argument | Direction | Role | Fortran type | Rust raw type | Shape | Contract |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `NM` | `input` | `scalar` | `INTEGER` | `*mut crate::FortranInteger` | scalar | must be set to the row dimension of the two-dimensional array parameter, A, as declared in the calling program dimension statement. NM is an INTEGER variable. |
| 2 | `N` | `input` | `scalar` | `INTEGER` | `*mut crate::FortranInteger` | scalar | is the order of the matrix A. N is an INTEGER variable. must be less than or equal to NM. |
| 3 | `LOW` | `input` | `scalar` | `INTEGER` | `*mut crate::FortranInteger` | scalar | two INTEGER variables determined by the balancing subroutine BALANC. If BALANC has not been used, set LOW=1 and IGH equal to the order of the matrix, N. |
| 4 | `IGH` | `input` | `scalar` | `INTEGER` | `*mut crate::FortranInteger` | scalar | two INTEGER variables determined by the balancing subroutine BALANC. If BALANC has not been used, set LOW=1 and IGH equal to the order of the matrix, N. |
| 5 | `A` | `input-output` | `array` | `REAL` | `*mut f32` | rank 2; dimensions (NM, *) | contains the general matrix to be reduced to upper Hessenberg form. A is a two-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned A(NM,N). contains the upper Hessenberg matrix. Some information about the orthogonal transformations used in the reduction is stored in the remaining triangle under the Hessenberg. |
| 6 | `ORT` | `output` | `array` | `REAL` | `*mut f32` | rank 1; dimensions (*) | contains further information about the orthogonal trans- formations used in the reduction. Only elements LOW+1 through IGH are used. ORT is a one-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned ORT(IGH). Questions and comments should be directed to B. S. Garbow, APPLIED MATHEMATICS DIVISION, ARGONNE NATIONAL LABORATORY. |

The authoritative public-documentation inventory records argument evidence ranges, nullability, shapes, relationships, leading dimensions, option values, and overwrite behavior. Native code does not retain ordinary argument pointers.

### Return value

This is a Fortran subroutine and has no direct return value; outputs are documented in its argument contract.

### Storage and array requirements

Array arguments use Fortran column-major storage and must satisfy their documented shape and leading-dimension relationships.

### Provider, ABI, and safety

Canonical Rust path: `slatec_sys::linear_algebra::eigen::orthes`. Native symbol: `orthes_`. Declaration feature: `eigen`. Provider feature: `linear-algebra-eigen`. ABI fingerprint: `subroutine:void(mut_i32,mut_i32,mut_i32,mut_i32,mut_f32_ptr_rank2,mut_f32_ptr_rank1)`.

# Safety

Every pointer must be non-null unless its argument record explicitly permits null, correctly aligned, and valid for its documented readable or writable extent. Callers must preserve Fortran column-major layout, dimensions, leading dimensions, workspace capacity, callback lifetime, and the selected provider's runtime serialization requirements. Mutable arguments may not alias in a way the native routine does not permit.
