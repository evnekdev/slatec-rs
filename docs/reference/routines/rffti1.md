# RFFTI1

[Back to family index](../routines-by-family.md) · [Alphabetical index](../routines-alphabetical.md) · [Coverage](../routine-coverage.md)

## Purpose

Initialize a real and an integer work array for RFFTF1 and RFFTB1.

## Description

Subroutine RFFTI1 initializes the work arrays WA and IFAC which are used in both RFFTF1 and RFFTB1. The prime factorization of N and a tabulation of the trigonometric functions are computed and stored in IFAC and WA, respectively. Input Argument N the length of the sequence to be transformed. Output Arguments WA a real work array which must be dimensioned at least N. IFAC an integer work array which must be dimensioned at least 15. The same work arrays can be used for both RFFTF1 and RFFTB1 as long as N remains unchanged. Different WA and IFAC arrays are required for different values of N. The contents of WA and IFAC must not be changed between calls of RFFTF1 or RFFTB1.
