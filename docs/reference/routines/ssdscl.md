## Purpose

Diagonal Scaling of system Ax = b. This routine scales (and unscales) the system Ax = b by symmetric diagonal scaling.

## Description

This routine scales (and unscales) the system Ax = b by symmetric diagonal scaling. The new system is: -1/2 -1/2 1/2 -1/2 D AD (D x) = D b when scaling is selected with the JOB parameter. When unscaling is selected this process is reversed. The true solution is also scaled or unscaled if ITOL is set appropriately, see below. Usage: INTEGER N, NELT, IA(NELT), JA(NELT), ISYM, JOB, ITOL REAL A(NELT), X(N), B(N), DINV(N) CALL SSDSCL( N, NELT, IA, JA, A, ISYM, X, B, DINV, JOB, ITOL ) =================== S L A P Column format ================== This routine requires that the matrix A be stored in the SLAP Column format. In this format the non-zeros are stored counting down columns (except for the diagonal entry, which must appear first in each "column") and are stored in the real array A. In other words, for each column in the matrix put the diagonal entry in A. Then put in the other non-zero elements going down the column (except the diagonal) in order. The IA array holds the row index for each non-zero. The JA array holds the offsets into the IA, A arrays for the beginning of each column. That is, IA(JA(ICOL)), A(JA(ICOL)) points to the beginning of the ICOL-th column in IA and A. IA(JA(ICOL+1)-1), A(JA(ICOL+1)-1) points to the end of the ICOL-th column. Note that we always have JA(N+1) = NELT+1, where N is the number of columns in the matrix and NELT is the number of non-zeros in the matrix. Here is an example of the SLAP Column storage format for a 5x5 Matrix (in the A and IA arrays '|' denotes the end of a column): 5x5 Matrix SLAP Column format for 5x5 matrix on left. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 |11 12 0 0 15| A: 11 21 51 | 22 12 | 33 53 | 44 | 55 15 35 |21 22 0 0 0| IA: 1 2 5 | 2 1 | 3 5 | 4 | 5 1 3 | 0 0 33 0 35| JA: 1 4 6 8 9 12 | 0 0 0 44 0| |51 0 53 0 55| With the SLAP format all of the "inner loops" of this routine should vectorize on machines with hardware support for vector gather/scatter operations. Your compiler may require a compiler directive to convince it that there are no implicit vector dependencies. Compiler directives for the Alliant FX/Fortran and CRI CFT/CFT77 compilers are supplied with the standard SLAP distribution. Cautions: This routine assumes that the diagonal of A is all non-zero and that the operation DINV = 1.0/DIAG(A) will not under- flow or overflow. This is done so that the loop vectorizes. Matrices with zero or near zero or very large entries will have numerical difficulties and must be fixed before this routine is called.

### Return value

This is a Fortran subroutine and has no direct return value; outputs are documented in its argument contract.

### Callback contract

This interface declares no callback argument.

### Error and status values

iterative method.  When ITOL = 11 the exact solution from common block SSLBLK will be used.  When the system is scaled then the true solution must also be scaled.  If ITOL is not 11 then this vector is not referenced. Common Blocks: SOLN    :INOUT   Real SOLN(N).  COMMON BLOCK /SSLBLK/ The true solution, SOLN, is scaled (or unscaled) if ITOL is set to 11, see above.

### Storage and workspace requirements

This interface declares no separately named workspace argument. Array storage, if any, is Fortran column-major and must satisfy the documented shape and leading-dimension relationships.

### Provider, ABI, and safety

Canonical Rust path: `slatec_sys::linear_algebra::dense::ssdscl`. Native symbol: `ssdscl_`. Declaration feature: `linear-algebra`. Provider feature: `linear-algebra-real`. ABI fingerprint: `subroutine:void(mut_i32,mut_i32,mut_i32_ptr_rank1,mut_i32_ptr_rank1,mut_f32_ptr_rank1,mut_i32,mut_f32_ptr_rank1,mut_f32_ptr_rank1,mut_f32_ptr_rank1,mut_i32,mut_i32)`.

# Safety

Every pointer must be non-null unless its argument record explicitly permits null, correctly aligned, and valid for its documented readable or writable extent. Callers must preserve Fortran column-major layout, dimensions, leading dimensions, workspace capacity, callback lifetime, and the selected provider's runtime serialization requirements. Mutable arguments may not alias in a way the native routine does not permit.
