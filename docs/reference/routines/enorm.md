## Purpose

Subsidiary to SNLS1, SNLS1E, SNSQ and SNSQE

## Description

Given an N-vector X, this function calculates the Euclidean norm of X. The Euclidean norm is computed by accumulating the sum of squares in three different sums. The sums of squares for the small and large components are scaled so that no overflows occur. Non-destructive underflows are permitted. Underflows and overflows do not occur in the computation of the unscaled sum of squares for the intermediate components. The definitions of small, intermediate and large components depend on two constants, RDWARF and RGIANT. The main restrictions on these constants are that RDWARF**2 not underflow and RGIANT**2 not overflow. The constants given here are suitable for every known computer. The function statement is REAL FUNCTION ENORM(N,X) where N is a positive integer input variable. X is an input array of length N.

### Arguments

| Argument | Direction | Fortran type | Rust raw type | Shape | Description | Relationships and requirements | Nullable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `N` | input | `INTEGER` (`explicit`) | `*mut crate::FortranInteger` | scalar | Given an N-vector X, this function calculates the Euclidean norm of X. | none stated in the separable source sentence Leading dimension: not established Workspace: not established | required; null is not permitted for an ordinary Fortran actual argument |
| `X` | input | `REAL` (`explicit`) | `*mut f32` | rank 1; dimensions (*) | Given an N-vector X, this function calculates the Euclidean norm of X. | none stated in the separable source sentence Leading dimension: not established Workspace: not established | required; null is not permitted for an ordinary Fortran actual argument |

The table reports compiler/interface facts separately from source-prologue semantics. Unknown intent, aliasing, workspace, leading-dimension, and retention rules remain explicit; parameter names alone are never treated as semantic evidence. Native code does not retain ordinary argument pointers unless a reviewed declaration explicitly says otherwise.

### Return value

The Fortran function returns `*mut f32` through the compiler-validated ABI recorded by the authoritative declaration fingerprint `not_publicly_owned`.
