## Purpose

Printer Plot of SLAP Column Format Matrix. Routine to print out a SLAP Column format matrix in a "printer plot" graphical representation.

## Description

*Usage: INTEGER N, NELT, IA(NELT), JA(NELT), ISYM, IUNIT DOUBLE PRECISION A(NELT) CALL DCPPLT( N, NELT, IA, JA, A, ISYM, IUNIT ) *Arguments: N :IN Integer Order of the Matrix. If N.gt.MAXORD, only the leading MAXORD x MAXORD submatrix will be printed. (Currently MAXORD = 225.) NELT :IN Integer. Number of non-zeros stored in A. IA :IN Integer IA(NELT). JA :IN Integer JA(NELT). A :IN Double Precision A(NELT). These arrays should hold the matrix A in the SLAP Column format. See "Description", below. ISYM :IN Integer. Flag to indicate symmetric storage format. If ISYM=0, all non-zero entries of the matrix are stored. If ISYM=1, the matrix is symmetric, and only the lower triangle of the matrix is stored. IUNIT :IN Integer. Fortran logical I/O device unit number to write the matrix to. This unit must be connected in a system dependent fashion to a file or the console or you will get a nasty message from the Fortran I/O libraries. *Description: This routine prints out a SLAP Column format matrix to the Fortran logical I/O unit number IUNIT. The numbers them selves are not printed out, but rather a one character representation of the numbers. Elements of the matrix that are not represented in the (IA,JA,A) arrays are denoted by ' ' character (a blank). Elements of A that are *ZERO* (and hence should really not be stored) are denoted by a '0' character. Elements of A that are *POSITIVE* are denoted by 'D' if they are Diagonal elements and '#' if they are off Diagonal elements. Elements of A that are *NEGATIVE* are denoted by 'N' if they are Diagonal elements and '*' if they are off Diagonal elements. =================== S L A P Column format ================== This routine requires that the matrix A be stored in the SLAP Column format. In this format the non-zeros are stored counting down columns (except for the diagonal entry, which must appear first in each "column") and are stored in the double precision array A. In other words, for each column in the matrix put the diagonal entry in A. Then put in the other non-zero elements going down the column (except the diagonal) in order. The IA array holds the row index for each non-zero. The JA array holds the offsets into the IA, A arrays for the beginning of each column. That is, IA(JA(ICOL)), A(JA(ICOL)) points to the beginning of the ICOL-th column in IA and A. IA(JA(ICOL+1)-1), A(JA(ICOL+1)-1) points to the end of the ICOL-th column. Note that we always have JA(N+1) = NELT+1, where N is the number of columns in the matrix and NELT is the number of non-zeros in the matrix. Here is an example of the SLAP Column storage format for a 5x5 Matrix (in the A and IA arrays '|' denotes the end of a column): 5x5 Matrix SLAP Column format for 5x5 matrix on left. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 |11 12 0 0 15| A: 11 21 51 | 22 12 | 33 53 | 44 | 55 15 35 |21 22 0 0 0| IA: 1 2 5 | 2 1 | 3 5 | 4 | 5 1 3 | 0 0 33 0 35| JA: 1 4 6 8 9 12 | 0 0 0 44 0| |51 0 53 0 55| *Cautions: This routine will attempt to write to the Fortran logical output unit IUNIT, if IUNIT .ne. 0. Thus, the user must make sure that this logical unit is attached to a file or terminal before calling this routine with a non-zero value for IUNIT. This routine does not check for the validity of a non-zero IUNIT unit number. *Portability: This routine, as distributed, can generate lines up to 229 characters long. Some Fortran systems have more restricted line lengths. Change parameter MAXORD and the large number in FORMAT 1010 to reduce this line length.

The table reports compiler/interface facts separately from source-prologue semantics. Unknown intent, aliasing, workspace, leading-dimension, and retention rules remain explicit; parameter names alone are never treated as semantic evidence. Native code does not retain ordinary argument pointers unless a reviewed declaration explicitly says otherwise.
