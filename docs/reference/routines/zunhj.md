[Family: Special functions](../families/special-functions.md) | [All families](../routines-by-family.md) | [Alphabetical index](../routines-alphabetical.md) | [Coverage](../routine-coverage.md)

## Purpose

Subsidiary to ZBESI and ZBESK

## Description

ZUNHJ COMPUTES PARAMETERS FOR BESSEL FUNCTIONS C(FNU,Z) = J(FNU,Z), Y(FNU,Z) OR H(I,FNU,Z) I=1,2 FOR LARGE ORDERS FNU BY MEANS OF THE UNIFORM ASYMPTOTIC EXPANSION C(FNU,Z)=C1*PHI*( ASUM*AIRY(ARG) + C2*BSUM*DAIRY(ARG) ) FOR PROPER CHOICES OF C1, C2, AIRY AND DAIRY WHERE AIRY IS AN AIRY FUNCTION AND DAIRY IS ITS DERIVATIVE. (2/3)*FNU*ZETA**1.5 = ZETA1-ZETA2, ZETA1=0.5*FNU*CLOG((1+W)/(1-W)), ZETA2=FNU*W FOR SCALING PURPOSES IN AIRY FUNCTIONS FROM CAIRY OR CBIRY. MCONJ=SIGN OF AIMAG(Z), BUT IS AMBIGUOUS WHEN Z IS REAL AND MUST BE SPECIFIED. IPMTR=0 RETURNS ALL PARAMETERS. IPMTR= 1 COMPUTES ALL EXCEPT ASUM AND BSUM.

The table reports compiler/interface facts separately from source-prologue semantics. Unknown intent, aliasing, workspace, leading-dimension, and retention rules remain explicit; parameter names alone are never treated as semantic evidence. Native code does not retain ordinary argument pointers unless a reviewed declaration explicitly says otherwise.
