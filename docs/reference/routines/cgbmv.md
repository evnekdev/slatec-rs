[Family: Linear algebra kernels](../families/linear-algebra-kernels.md) | [All families](../routines-by-family.md) | [Alphabetical index](../routines-alphabetical.md) | [Coverage](../routine-coverage.md)

## Purpose

Multiply a complex vector by a complex general band matrix.

## Description

CGBMV performs one of the matrix-vector operations y := alpha*A*x + beta*y, or y := alpha*A'*x + beta*y, or y := alpha*conjg( A' )*x + beta*y, where alpha and beta are scalars, x and y are vectors and A is an m by n band matrix, with kl sub-diagonals and ku super-diagonals. Parameters ========== TRANS - CHARACTER*1. On entry, TRANS specifies the operation to be performed as follows: TRANS = 'N' or 'n' y := alpha*A*x + beta*y. TRANS = 'T' or 't' y := alpha*A'*x + beta*y. TRANS = 'C' or 'c' y := alpha*conjg( A' )*x + beta*y. Unchanged on exit. M - INTEGER. On entry, M specifies the number of rows of the matrix A. M must be at least zero. Unchanged on exit. N - INTEGER. On entry, N specifies the number of columns of the matrix A. N must be at least zero. Unchanged on exit. KL - INTEGER. On entry, KL specifies the number of sub-diagonals of the matrix A. KL must satisfy 0 .le. KL. Unchanged on exit. KU - INTEGER. On entry, KU specifies the number of super-diagonals of the matrix A. KU must satisfy 0 .le. KU. Unchanged on exit. ALPHA - COMPLEX . On entry, ALPHA specifies the scalar alpha. Unchanged on exit. A - COMPLEX array of DIMENSION ( LDA, n ). Before entry, the leading ( kl + ku + 1 ) by n part of the array A must contain the matrix of coefficients, supplied column by column, with the leading diagonal of the matrix in row ( ku + 1 ) of the array, the first super-diagonal starting at position 2 in row ku, the first sub-diagonal starting at position 1 in row ( ku + 2 ), and so on. Elements in the array A that do not correspond to elements in the band matrix (such as the top left ku by ku triangle) are not referenced. The following program segment will transfer a band matrix from conventional full matrix storage to band storage: DO 20, J = 1, N K = KU + 1 - J DO 10, I = MAX( 1, J - KU ), MIN( M, J + KL ) A( K + I, J ) = matrix( I, J ) 10 CONTINUE 20 CONTINUE Unchanged on exit. LDA - INTEGER. On entry, LDA specifies the first dimension of A as declared in the calling (sub) program. LDA must be at least ( kl + ku + 1 ). Unchanged on exit. X - COMPLEX array of DIMENSION at least ( 1 + ( n - 1 )*abs( INCX ) ) when TRANS = 'N' or 'n' and at least ( 1 + ( m - 1 )*abs( INCX ) ) otherwise. Before entry, the incremented array X must contain the vector x. Unchanged on exit. INCX - INTEGER. On entry, INCX specifies the increment for the elements of X. INCX must not be zero. Unchanged on exit. BETA - COMPLEX . On entry, BETA specifies the scalar beta. When BETA is supplied as zero then Y need not be set on input. Unchanged on exit. Y - COMPLEX array of DIMENSION at least ( 1 + ( m - 1 )*abs( INCY ) ) when TRANS = 'N' or 'n' and at least ( 1 + ( n - 1 )*abs( INCY ) ) otherwise. Before entry, the incremented array Y must contain the vector y. On exit, Y is overwritten by the updated vector y. INCY - INTEGER. On entry, INCY specifies the increment for the elements of Y. INCY must not be zero. Unchanged on exit.

Argument evidence records nullability, shape, relationships, leading dimensions, workspace rules, options, and overwrite behavior in the authoritative public-documentation inventory. Native code does not retain ordinary argument pointers.

### Return value

This is a Fortran subroutine and has no direct return value; outputs are documented in its argument contract.

### Callback contract

This interface declares no callback argument.

### Error and status values

The selected source does not provide a separate error-status section. Any status output argument is identified in the argument table; callers must also respect the legacy SLATEC error-runtime behavior described by the source.

### Storage and workspace requirements

This interface declares no separately named workspace argument. Array storage, if any, is Fortran column-major and must satisfy the documented shape and leading-dimension relationships.

### Provider, ABI, and safety

Canonical Rust path: `slatec_sys::blas::level2::cgbmv`. Native symbol: `cgbmv_`. Declaration feature: `blas-level2`. Provider feature: `blas-level2`. ABI fingerprint: `unavailable`.

# Safety

Every pointer must be non-null unless its argument record explicitly permits null, correctly aligned, and valid for its documented readable or writable extent. Callers must preserve Fortran column-major layout, dimensions, leading dimensions, workspace capacity, callback lifetime, and the selected provider's runtime serialization requirements. Mutable arguments may not alias in a way the native routine does not permit.
