### Arguments

| # | Argument | Direction | Role | Fortran type | Rust raw type | Shape | Contract |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `UPLO` | `input` | `scalar` | `CHARACTER` | `*mut core::ffi::c_char` | scalar | CHARACTER*1. On entry, UPLO specifies whether the upper or lower triangular part of the array A is to be referenced as follows: 'U' or 'u' Only the upper triangular part of A is to be referenced. 'L' or 'l' Only the lower triangular part of A Unchanged on exit. |
| 2 | `N` | `input` | `scalar` | `INTEGER` | `*mut crate::FortranInteger` | scalar | INTEGER. On entry, N specifies the order of the matrix A. must be at least zero. Unchanged on exit. |
| 3 | `ALPHA` | `input` | `scalar` | `DOUBLE PRECISION` | `*mut f64` | scalar | DOUBLE PRECISION. On entry, ALPHA specifies the scalar alpha. Unchanged on exit. |
| 4 | `X` | `input` | `array` | `DOUBLE PRECISION` | `*mut f64` | rank 1; dimensions (*) | DOUBLE PRECISION array of dimension at least ( 1 + ( n - 1)*abs( INCX)). Before entry, the incremented array X must contain the n element vector x. Unchanged on exit. |
| 5 | `INCX` | `input` | `scalar` | `INTEGER` | `*mut crate::FortranInteger` | scalar | INTEGER. On entry, INCX specifies the increment for the elements of X. INCX must not be zero. Unchanged on exit. |
| 6 | `A` | `input` | `array` | `DOUBLE PRECISION` | `*mut f64` | rank 2; dimensions (LDA, *) | = alpha*x*x' + A, where alpha is a real scalar, x is an n element vector and A is an n by n symmetric matrix. DOUBLE PRECISION array of DIMENSION ( LDA, n ). Before entry with UPLO = 'U' or 'u', the leading n by n upper triangular part of the array A must contain the upper triangular part of the symmetric matrix and the strictly lower triangular part of A is not referenced. On exit, the upper triangular part of the array A is overwritten by the upper triangular part of the updated matrix. Before entry with UPLO = 'L' or 'l', the leading n by n lower triangular part of the array A must contain the lower upper triangular part of A is not referenced. On exit, the lower triangular part of the array A is overwritten by the lower triangular part of the updated matrix. |
| 7 | `LDA` | `input` | `scalar` | `INTEGER` | `*mut crate::FortranInteger` | scalar | INTEGER. On entry, LDA specifies the first dimension of A as declared in the calling (sub) program. LDA must be at least max( 1, n ). Unchanged on exit. |

The authoritative public-documentation inventory records argument evidence ranges, nullability, shapes, relationships, leading dimensions, option values, and overwrite behavior. Native code does not retain ordinary argument pointers.

### Return value

This is a Fortran subroutine and has no direct return value; outputs are documented in its argument contract.

### Storage and array requirements

Array arguments use Fortran column-major storage and must satisfy their documented shape and leading-dimension relationships.

### Provider, ABI, and safety

Canonical Rust path: `slatec_sys::blas::level2::dsyr`. Native symbol: `dsyr_`. Declaration feature: `blas-level2`. Provider feature: `blas-level2`. ABI fingerprint: `unavailable`.

# Safety

Every pointer must be non-null unless its argument record explicitly permits null, correctly aligned, and valid for its documented readable or writable extent. Callers must preserve Fortran column-major layout, dimensions, leading dimensions, workspace capacity, callback lifetime, and the selected provider's runtime serialization requirements. Mutable arguments may not alias in a way the native routine does not permit.
