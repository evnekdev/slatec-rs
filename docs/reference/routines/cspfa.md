## Purpose

Factor a complex symmetric matrix stored in packed form by elimination with symmetric pivoting.

## Description

CSPFA factors a complex symmetric matrix stored in packed form by elimination with symmetric pivoting. To solve A*X = B , follow CSPFA by CSPSL. To compute INVERSE(A)*C , follow CSPFA by CSPSL. To compute DETERMINANT(A) , follow CSPFA by CSPDI. To compute INVERSE(A) , follow CSPFA by CSPDI. On Entry AP COMPLEX (N*(N+1)/2) the packed form of a symmetric matrix A . The columns of the upper triangle are stored sequentially in a one-dimensional array of length N*(N+1)/2 . See comments below for details. N INTEGER the order of the matrix A . On Return AP a block diagonal matrix and the multipliers which were used to obtain it stored in packed form. The factorization can be written A = U*D*TRANS(U) where U is a product of permutation and unit upper triangular matrices , TRANS(U) is the transpose of U , and D is block diagonal with 1 by 1 and 2 by 2 blocks. KVPT INTEGER(N) an integer vector of pivot indices. INFO INTEGER = 0 normal value. = K if the K-th pivot block is singular. This is not an error condition for this subroutine, but it does indicate that CSPSL or CSPDI may divide by zero if called. Packed Storage The following program segment will pack the upper triangle of a symmetric matrix. K = 0 DO 20 J = 1, N DO 10 I = 1, J K = K + 1 AP(K) = A(I,J) 10 CONTINUE 20 CONTINUE
