## Purpose

Factor a complex symmetric matrix stored in packed form by elimination with symmetric pivoting and estimate the condition number of the matrix.

## Description

CSPCO factors a complex symmetric matrix stored in packed form by elimination with symmetric pivoting and estimates the condition of the matrix. If RCOND is not needed, CSPFA is slightly faster. To solve A*X = B , follow CSPCO by CSPSL. To compute INVERSE(A)*C , follow CSPCO by CSPSL. To compute INVERSE(A) , follow CSPCO by CSPDI. To compute DETERMINANT(A) , follow CSPCO by CSPDI. On Entry AP COMPLEX (N*(N+1)/2) the packed form of a symmetric matrix A . The columns of the upper triangle are stored sequentially in a one-dimensional array of length N*(N+1)/2 . See comments below for details. N INTEGER the order of the matrix A . On Return AP a block diagonal matrix and the multipliers which were used to obtain it stored in packed form. The factorization can be written A = U*D*TRANS(U) where U is a product of permutation and unit upper triangular matrices , TRANS(U) is the transpose of U , and D is block diagonal with 1 by 1 and 2 by 2 blocks. KVPT INTEGER(N) an integer vector of pivot indices. RCOND REAL an estimate of the reciprocal condition of A . For the system A*X = B , relative perturbations in A and B of size EPSILON may cause relative perturbations in X of size EPSILON/RCOND . If RCOND is so small that the logical expression 1.0 + RCOND .EQ. 1.0 is true, then A may be singular to working precision. In particular, RCOND is zero if exact singularity is detected or the estimate underflows. Z COMPLEX(N) a work vector whose contents are usually unimportant. If A is close to a singular matrix, then Z is an approximate null vector in the sense that NORM(A*Z) = RCOND*NORM(A)*NORM(Z) . Packed Storage The following program segment will pack the upper triangle of a symmetric matrix. K = 0 DO 20 J = 1, N DO 10 I = 1, J K = K + 1 AP(K) = A(I,J) 10 CONTINUE 20 CONTINUE

## Evidence notes

Description selected from `canonical_source_prologue` using `PURPOSE`; confidence: `high`. External-reference statuses are generated offline from separately cached source files, directory indexes, and TOC evidence.

## Interface documentation quality

- Evidence level: `argument_contract_incomplete`
- Description provenance: `source_prologue`
- Assessment: the routine description and ABI rows are complete, but at least one argument lacks separable semantic evidence
- Dedicated family page: [Dense linear algebra](../families/dense-linear-algebra.md)

The table reports compiler/interface facts separately from source-prologue semantics. Unknown intent, aliasing, workspace, leading-dimension, and retention rules remain explicit; parameter names alone are never treated as semantic evidence. Native code does not retain ordinary argument pointers unless a reviewed declaration explicitly says otherwise.

### ABI and safety

Canonical path: `slatec_sys::linear_algebra::packed::complex::cspco`. Native symbol: `cspco_`. Feature: `linear-algebra-complex`. Provider status: `selected_provider_verified`. ABI fingerprint: `subroutine:void(mut_complex32_array_rank1,mut_i32,mut_i32_array_rank1,mut_f32,mut_complex32_array_rank1)`. Every pointer must be aligned and valid for the full source-defined readable or writable extent; callers must uphold array dimensions, leading dimensions, workspace formulas, aliasing restrictions, callback lifetimes, and process-global runtime serialization.
