## Purpose

Factor a complex Hermitian positive definite matrix stored in packed form.

## Description

CPPFA factors a complex Hermitian positive definite matrix stored in packed form. CPPFA is usually called by CPPCO, but it can be called directly with a saving in time if RCOND is not needed. (Time for CPPCO) = (1 + 18/N)*(Time for CPPFA) . On Entry AP COMPLEX (N*(N+1)/2) the packed form of a Hermitian matrix A . The columns of the upper triangle are stored sequentially in a one-dimensional array of length N*(N+1)/2 . See comments below for details. N INTEGER the order of the matrix A . On Return AP an upper triangular matrix R , stored in packed form, so that A = CTRANS(R)*R . INFO INTEGER = 0 for normal return. = K If the leading minor of order K is not positive definite. Packed Storage The following program segment will pack the upper triangle of a Hermitian matrix. K = 0 DO 20 J = 1, N DO 10 I = 1, J K = K + 1 AP(K) = A(I,J) 10 CONTINUE 20 CONTINUE
