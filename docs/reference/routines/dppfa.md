[Family: Dense linear algebra](../families/dense-linear-algebra.md) | [All families](../routines-by-family.md) | [Alphabetical index](../routines-alphabetical.md) | [Coverage](../routine-coverage.md)

## Purpose

Factor a real symmetric positive definite matrix stored in packed form.

## Description

DPPFA factors a double precision symmetric positive definite matrix stored in packed form. DPPFA is usually called by DPPCO, but it can be called directly with a saving in time if RCOND is not needed. (time for DPPCO) = (1 + 18/N)*(time for DPPFA) . On Entry AP DOUBLE PRECISION (N*(N+1)/2) the packed form of a symmetric matrix A . The columns of the upper triangle are stored sequentially in a one-dimensional array of length N*(N+1)/2 . See comments below for details. N INTEGER the order of the matrix A . On Return AP an upper triangular matrix R , stored in packed form, so that A = TRANS(R)*R . INFO INTEGER = 0 for normal return. = K if the leading minor of order K is not positive definite. Packed Storage The following program segment will pack the upper triangle of a symmetric matrix. K = 0 DO 20 J = 1, N DO 10 I = 1, J K = K + 1 AP(K) = A(I,J) 10 CONTINUE 20 CONTINUE

## Interface documentation quality

- Documentation work status: `complete-structured`
- Documentation evidence: source prologue, verified source hash, and fixed-form executable analysis where an argument section is absent

### Arguments

| # | Argument | Direction | Role | Fortran type | Rust raw type | Shape | Contract |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `AP` | `input-output` | `array` | `DOUBLE PRECISION` | `*mut f64` | rank 1; dimensions (*) | Array argument classified by fixed-form executable read/write analysis. |
| 2 | `N` | `input` | `scalar` | `INTEGER` | `*mut crate::FortranInteger` | scalar | Scalar argument classified by fixed-form executable read/write analysis. |
| 3 | `INFO` | `status-output` | `status` | `INTEGER` | `*mut crate::FortranInteger` | scalar | Status argument classified by fixed-form executable read/write analysis. |

Argument evidence records nullability, shape, relationships, leading dimensions, workspace rules, options, and overwrite behavior in the authoritative public-documentation inventory. Native code does not retain ordinary argument pointers.

### Return value

This is a Fortran subroutine and has no direct return value; outputs are documented in its argument contract.

### Callback contract

This interface declares no callback argument.

### Error and status values

The selected source does not provide a separate error-status section. Any status output argument is identified in the argument table; callers must also respect the legacy SLATEC error-runtime behavior described by the source.

### Storage and workspace requirements

This interface declares no separately named workspace argument. Array storage, if any, is Fortran column-major and must satisfy the documented shape and leading-dimension relationships.

### Provider, ABI, and safety

Canonical Rust path: `slatec_sys::linear_algebra::packed::dppfa`. Native symbol: `dppfa_`. Declaration feature: `linear-algebra`. Provider feature: `linear-algebra-real`. ABI fingerprint: `subroutine:void(mut_f64_ptr_rank1,mut_i32,mut_i32)`.

# Safety

Every pointer must be non-null unless its argument record explicitly permits null, correctly aligned, and valid for its documented readable or writable extent. Callers must preserve Fortran column-major layout, dimensions, leading dimensions, workspace capacity, callback lifetime, and the selected provider's runtime serialization requirements. Mutable arguments may not alias in a way the native routine does not permit.
