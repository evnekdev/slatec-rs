## Purpose

Subsidiary to SPLP

## Description

THIS SUBPROGRAM IS FROM THE SPLP( ) PACKAGE. IT PERFORMS THE TASK OF DEFINING THE ENTRIES OF THE BASIS MATRIX AND DECOMPOSING IT USING THE LA05 PACKAGE. IT IS THE MAIN PART OF THE PROCEDURE (DECOMPOSE BASIS MATRIX).

- Scalar kind: `real`
- Primary family: `Optimization and least squares`
- Mathematical domain: `optimization`

## Project coverage

- Source status: `canonical_verified`
- Raw-binding status: `bound`
- Build/profile status: `selected_by_profile`
- Audit status: `family_inventory_only`
- Safe-API status: `none`
- Implementation status: `not_exposed_as_safe_api`
- Deferment status: Catalogue inclusion does not imply a Rust binding or safe API.

The table reports compiler/interface facts separately from source-prologue semantics. Unknown intent, aliasing, workspace, leading-dimension, and retention rules remain explicit; parameter names alone are never treated as semantic evidence. Native code does not retain ordinary argument pointers unless a reviewed declaration explicitly says otherwise.
