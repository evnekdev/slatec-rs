# J4SAVE

[Family: Error handling](../families/error-handling.md) | [All families](../routines-by-family.md) | [Alphabetical index](../routines-alphabetical.md) | [Coverage](../routine-coverage.md)

## Purpose

Save or recall global variables needed by error handling routines.

## Description

Abstract J4SAVE saves and recalls several global variables needed by the library error handling routines.

## Classification

- Historical role: `subsidiary`
- Program-unit kind: `function`
- Identity kind: `function`
- Identity status: `retained_verified_program_unit`
- Precision: `unknown`
- Scalar kind: `unknown`
- Primary family: `Error handling`
- Mathematical domain: `runtime-support`
- Package provenance: `slatec-error`
- Family evidence: `package_provenance` (`high`)

## Project coverage

- Source status: `canonical_verified`
- Raw-binding status: `not_bound`
- Build/profile status: `available_but_unselected`
- Audit status: `identity_only`
- Safe-API status: `none`
- Implementation status: `not_exposed_as_safe_api`
- Deferment status: Catalogue inclusion does not imply a Rust binding or safe API.

## Providers

- Canonical provider: `main-src/src/j4save.f` (`pinned-reproducible-subset`)
- Alternate providers:
  - `src/j4save.f` (`live-main-source`)
  - `err/j4save.f` (`legacy-error-directory`)

## Evidence notes

Description selected from `canonical_source_prologue` using `PURPOSE`; confidence: `high`. External-reference statuses are generated offline from separately cached source files, directory indexes, and TOC evidence.

## Interface documentation quality

- Evidence level: `subsidiary_minimal`
- Description provenance: `source_prologue`
- Assessment: the non-public subsidiary has purpose, role, source, and disposition evidence
- Dedicated family page: [Error handling](../families/error-handling.md)

### Arguments

| Argument | Direction | Fortran type | Rust raw type | Shape | Description | Relationships and requirements | Nullable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `IWHICH` | unavailable | `INTEGER` (`implicit_rule`) | `*mut crate::FortranInteger` | scalar | No separable argument description was found in the selected source prologue. | unavailable Leading dimension: not established Workspace: not established | required; null is not permitted for an ordinary Fortran actual argument |
| `IVALUE` | unavailable | `INTEGER` (`implicit_rule`) | `*mut crate::FortranInteger` | scalar | No separable argument description was found in the selected source prologue. | unavailable Leading dimension: not established Workspace: not established | required; null is not permitted for an ordinary Fortran actual argument |
| `ISET` | unavailable | `LOGICAL` (`explicit`) | `*mut crate::FortranLogical` | scalar | No separable argument description was found in the selected source prologue. | unavailable Leading dimension: not established Workspace: not established | required; null is not permitted for an ordinary Fortran actual argument |

The table reports compiler/interface facts separately from source-prologue semantics. Unknown intent, aliasing, workspace, leading-dimension, and retention rules remain explicit; parameter names alone are never treated as semantic evidence. Native code does not retain ordinary argument pointers unless a reviewed declaration explicitly says otherwise.

### Return value

The Fortran function returns `*mut crate::FortranInteger` through the compiler-validated ABI recorded by the authoritative declaration fingerprint `not_publicly_owned`.

## Raw Rust API status

This generated status is evidence only; see the [authoritative inventory](../../../generated/raw-api/routine-status.json).

- Public raw API status: `support-routine`
- ABI validation: `pending`
- Canonical Rust path: `not_promoted`
- Public declaration feature: `not_assigned`
- `all`-feature reachability: `not_enabled_by_all`
- Provider-backed callable symbol: `yes` (`observed_exactly_once`)
- Documentation status: `not_documented`
- Compile-test status: `compiler_observed`
- Link-test status: `not_tested`
- Runtime validation: `not-recorded`
- Safe-wrapper status: `not_safely_wrapped`
- Exclusion or deferment reason: `runtime or machine-support unit is not independently callable`
