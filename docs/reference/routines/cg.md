## Purpose

Compute the eigenvalues and, optionally, the eigenvectors of a complex general matrix.

## Description

This subroutine calls the recommended sequence of subroutines from the eigensystem subroutine package (EISPACK) to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors (if desired) of a COMPLEX GENERAL matrix. On INPUT NM must be set to the row dimension of the two-dimensional array parameters, AR, AI, ZR and ZI, as declared in the calling program dimension statement. NM is an INTEGER variable. N is the order of the matrix A=(AR,AI). N is an INTEGER variable. N must be less than or equal to NM. AR and AI contain the real and imaginary parts, respectively, of the complex general matrix. AR and AI are two-dimensional REAL arrays, dimensioned AR(NM,N) and AI(NM,N). MATZ is an INTEGER variable set equal to zero if only eigenvalues are desired. Otherwise, it is set to any non-zero integer for both eigenvalues and eigenvectors. On OUTPUT WR and WI contain the real and imaginary parts, respectively, of the eigenvalues. WR and WI are one-dimensional REAL arrays, dimensioned WR(N) and WI(N). ZR and ZI contain the real and imaginary parts, respectively, of the eigenvectors if MATZ is not zero. ZR and ZI are two-dimensional REAL arrays, dimensioned ZR(NM,N) and ZI(NM,N). IERR is an INTEGER flag set to Zero for normal return, 10*N if N is greater than NM, J if the J-th eigenvalue has not been determined after a total of 30 iterations. The eigenvalues should be correct for indices IERR+1, IERR+2, ..., N, but no eigenvectors are computed. FV1, FV2, and FV3 are one-dimensional REAL arrays used for temporary storage, dimensioned FV1(N), FV2(N), and FV3(N). Questions and comments should be directed to B. S.
