## Purpose

Compute the eigenvalues and, optionally, the eigenvectors of a symmetric band matrix.

## Description

This subroutine calls the recommended sequence of subroutines from the eigensystem subroutine package (EISPACK) to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors (if desired) of a REAL SYMMETRIC BAND matrix. On Input NM must be set to the row dimension of the two-dimensional array parameters, A and Z, as declared in the calling program dimension statement. NM is an INTEGER variable. N is the order of the matrix A. N is an INTEGER variable. N must be less than or equal to NM. MB is the half band width of the matrix, defined as the number of adjacent diagonals, including the principal diagonal, required to specify the non-zero portion of the lower triangle of the matrix. MB must be less than or equal to N. MB is an INTEGER variable. A contains the lower triangle of the real symmetric band matrix. Its lowest subdiagonal is stored in the last N+1-MB positions of the first column, its next subdiagonal in the last N+2-MB positions of the second column, further subdiagonals similarly, and finally its principal diagonal in the N positions of the last column. Contents of storage locations not part of the matrix are arbitrary. A is a two-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned A(NM,MB). MATZ is an INTEGER variable set equal to zero if only eigenvalues are desired. Otherwise, it is set to any non-zero integer for both eigenvalues and eigenvectors. On Output A has been destroyed. W contains the eigenvalues in ascending order. W is a one- dimensional REAL array, dimensioned W(N). Z contains the eigenvectors if MATZ is not zero. The eigenvectors are orthonormal. Z is a two-dimensional REAL array, dimensioned Z(NM,N). IERR is an INTEGER flag set to Zero for normal return, 10*N if N is greater than NM, 12*N if MB is either non-positive or greater than N, J if the J-th eigenvalue has not been determined after 30 iterations. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors, if requested, should be correct for indices 1, 2, ..., IERR-1. FV1 and FV2 are one-dimensional REAL arrays used for temporary storage, dimensioned FV1(N) and FV2(N).

Argument evidence records nullability, shape, relationships, leading dimensions, workspace rules, options, and overwrite behavior in the authoritative public-documentation inventory. Native code does not retain ordinary argument pointers.

### Return value

This is a Fortran subroutine and has no direct return value; outputs are documented in its argument contract.

### Callback contract

This interface declares no callback argument.

### Error and status values

The selected source does not provide a separate error-status section. Any status output argument is identified in the argument table; callers must also respect the legacy SLATEC error-runtime behavior described by the source.

### Storage and workspace requirements

`W`: Workspace argument classified by fixed-form executable read/write analysis.

### Provider, ABI, and safety

Canonical Rust path: `slatec_sys::linear_algebra::eigen::rsb`. Native symbol: `rsb_`. Declaration feature: `eigen`. Provider feature: `linear-algebra-eigen`. ABI fingerprint: `subroutine:void(mut_i32,mut_i32,mut_i32,mut_f32_ptr_rank2,mut_f32_ptr_rank1,mut_i32,mut_f32_ptr_rank2,mut_f32_ptr_rank1,mut_f32_ptr_rank1,mut_i32)`.

# Safety

Every pointer must be non-null unless its argument record explicitly permits null, correctly aligned, and valid for its documented readable or writable extent. Callers must preserve Fortran column-major layout, dimensions, leading dimensions, workspace capacity, callback lifetime, and the selected provider's runtime serialization requirements. Mutable arguments may not alias in a way the native routine does not permit.
