[Family: FFTPACK transforms](../families/fftpack-transforms.md) | [All families](../routines-by-family.md) | [Alphabetical index](../routines-alphabetical.md) | [Coverage](../routine-coverage.md)

## Purpose

Compute the unnormalized inverse of SINQF.

## Description

Subroutine SINQB computes the fast Fourier transform of quarter wave data. That is, SINQB computes a sequence from its representation in terms of a sine series with odd wave numbers. the transform is defined below at output parameter X. SINQF is the unnormalized inverse of SINQB since a call of SINQB followed by a call of SINQF will multiply the input sequence X by 4*N. The array WSAVE which is used by subroutine SINQB must be initialized by calling subroutine SINQI(N,WSAVE).

### Arguments

| # | Argument | Direction | Role | Fortran type | Rust raw type | Shape | Contract |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `N` | `input` | `scalar` | `INTEGER` | `*mut crate::FortranInteger` | scalar | the length of the array X to be transformed. The method is most efficient when N is a product of small primes. |
| 2 | `X` | `input-output` | `array` | `REAL` | `*mut f32` | rank 1; dimensions (*) | an array which contains the sequence to be transformed For I=1,. ,N the sum from K=1 to K=N of 4*X(K)*SIN((2*K-1)*I*PI/(2*N)) a call of SINQB followed by a call of SINQF will multiply the sequence X by 4*N. Therefore SINQF is the unnormalized inverse of SINQB. |
| 3 | `WSAVE` | `workspace-output` | `workspace` | `REAL` | `*mut f32` | rank 1; dimensions (*) | a work array which must be dimensioned at least 3*N+15 in the program that calls SINQB. The WSAVE array must be initialized by calling subroutine SINQI(N,WSAVE), and a different WSAVE array must be used for each different value of N. This initialization does not have to be repeated so long as N remains unchanged. Thus subsequent transforms can be obtained faster than the first. contains initialization calculations which must not be destroyed between calls of SINQB or SINQF. |

The authoritative public-documentation inventory records argument evidence ranges, nullability, shapes, relationships, leading dimensions, option values, and overwrite behavior. Native code does not retain ordinary argument pointers.

### Return value

This is a Fortran subroutine and has no direct return value; outputs are documented in its argument contract.

### Storage and workspace requirements

`WSAVE`: a work array which must be dimensioned at least 3*N+15 in the program that calls SINQB. The WSAVE array must be initialized by calling subroutine SINQI(N,WSAVE), and a different WSAVE array must be used for each different value of N. This initialization does not have to be repeated so long as N remains unchanged. Thus subsequent transforms can be obtained faster than the first. contains initialization calculations which must not be destroyed between calls of SINQB or SINQF.

### Provider, ABI, and safety

Canonical Rust path: `slatec_sys::fftpack::sinqb`. Native symbol: `sinqb_`. Declaration feature: `fftpack`. Provider feature: `fftpack-extended-real`. ABI fingerprint: `subroutine:void(mut_i32,mut_f32_ptr_rank1,mut_f32_ptr_rank1)`.

# Safety

Every pointer must be non-null unless its argument record explicitly permits null, correctly aligned, and valid for its documented readable or writable extent. Callers must preserve Fortran column-major layout, dimensions, leading dimensions, workspace capacity, callback lifetime, and the selected provider's runtime serialization requirements. Mutable arguments may not alias in a way the native routine does not permit.
