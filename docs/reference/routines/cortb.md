## Purpose

Form the eigenvectors of a complex general matrix from eigenvectors of upper Hessenberg matrix output from CORTH.

## Description

This subroutine is a translation of a complex analogue of the ALGOL procedure ORTBAK, NUM. MATH. 12, 349-368(1968) by Martin and Wilkinson. HANDBOOK FOR AUTO. COMP., VOL.II-LINEAR ALGEBRA, 339-358(1971). This subroutine forms the eigenvectors of a COMPLEX GENERAL matrix by back transforming those of the corresponding upper Hessenberg matrix determined by CORTH. On INPUT NM must be set to the row dimension of the two-dimensional array parameters, AR, AI, ZR, and ZI, as declared in the calling program dimension statement. NM is an INTEGER variable. LOW and IGH are two INTEGER variables determined by the balancing subroutine CBAL. If CBAL has not been used, set LOW=1 and IGH equal to the order of the matrix. AR and AI contain information about the unitary trans- formations used in the reduction by CORTH in their strict lower triangles. AR and AI are two-dimensional REAL arrays, dimensioned AR(NM,IGH) and AI(NM,IGH). ORTR and ORTI contain further information about the unitary transformations used in the reduction by CORTH. Only elements LOW through IGH are used. ORTR and ORTI are one-dimensional REAL arrays, dimensioned ORTR(IGH) and ORTI(IGH). M is the number of columns of Z=(ZR,ZI) to be back transformed. M is an INTEGER variable. ZR and ZI contain the real and imaginary parts, respectively, of the eigenvectors to be back transformed in their first M columns. ZR and ZI are two-dimensional REAL arrays, dimensioned ZR(NM,M) and ZI(NM,M). On OUTPUT ZR and ZI contain the real and imaginary parts, respectively, of the transformed eigenvectors in their first M columns. ORTR and ORTI have been altered. Note that CORTB preserves vector Euclidean norms. Questions and comments should be directed to B. S.

### Arguments

| # | Argument | Direction | Role | Fortran type | Rust raw type | Shape | Contract |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `NM` | `input` | `scalar` | `INTEGER` | `*mut crate::FortranInteger` | scalar | Scalar argument classified by fixed-form executable read/write analysis. |
| 2 | `LOW` | `input` | `scalar` | `INTEGER` | `*mut crate::FortranInteger` | scalar | Scalar argument classified by fixed-form executable read/write analysis. |

| 5 | `AI` | `input` | `array` | `REAL` | `*mut f32` | rank 2; dimensions (NM, *) | Array argument classified by fixed-form executable read/write analysis. |

Argument evidence records nullability, shape, relationships, leading dimensions, workspace rules, options, and overwrite behavior in the authoritative public-documentation inventory. Native code does not retain ordinary argument pointers.

### Return value

This is a Fortran subroutine and has no direct return value; outputs are documented in its argument contract.

### Callback contract

This interface declares no callback argument.

### Error and status values

The selected source does not provide a separate error-status section. Any status output argument is identified in the argument table; callers must also respect the legacy SLATEC error-runtime behavior described by the source.

### Storage and workspace requirements

This interface declares no separately named workspace argument. Array storage, if any, is Fortran column-major and must satisfy the documented shape and leading-dimension relationships.

### Provider, ABI, and safety

Canonical Rust path: `slatec_sys::linear_algebra::eigen::cortb`. Native symbol: `cortb_`. Declaration feature: `eigen`. Provider feature: `linear-algebra-eigen`. ABI fingerprint: `subroutine:void(mut_i32,mut_i32,mut_i32,mut_f32_ptr_rank2,mut_f32_ptr_rank2,mut_f32_ptr_rank1,mut_f32_ptr_rank1,mut_i32,mut_f32_ptr_rank2,mut_f32_ptr_rank2)`.

# Safety

Every pointer must be non-null unless its argument record explicitly permits null, correctly aligned, and valid for its documented readable or writable extent. Callers must preserve Fortran column-major layout, dimensions, leading dimensions, workspace capacity, callback lifetime, and the selected provider's runtime serialization requirements. Mutable arguments may not alias in a way the native routine does not permit.
