# Purpose

DBI(X) calculates the double precision Airy function of the second kind for double precision argument X. Series for BIF on the interval -1.00000E+00 to 1.00000E+00 with weighted error 1.45E-32 log weighted error 31.84 significant figures required 30.85 decimal places required 32.40 Series for BIG on the interval -1.00000E+00 to 1.00000E+00 with weighted error 1.29E-33 log weighted error 32.89 significant figures required 31.48 decimal places required 33.45 Series for BIF2 on the interval 1.00000E+00 to 8.00000E+00 with weighted error 6.08E-32 log weighted error 31.22 approx significant figures required 30.8 decimal places required 31.80 Series for BIG2 on the interval 1.00000E+00 to 8.00000E+00 with weighted error 4.91E-33 log weighted error 32.31 approx significant figures required 31.6 decimal places required 32.90

# Description

This canonical unsafe binding exposes original SLATEC routine `DBI`. Its documented behavior is taken from the selected, source-hash-verified provider prologue; the exact implementation source is [DBI](https://www.netlib.org/slatec/fnlib/dbi.f).

# Arguments

## `X`

**Direction:** `input`. **Fortran type:** `DOUBLE PRECISION`. **Rust ABI type:** `*mut f64`. **Shape:** scalar.

Input value at which the source-defined function is evaluated: Evaluate the Bairy function (the Airy function of the second kind)

# Return value

This Fortran function returns its scalar result using the compiler-validated ABI fingerprint `unavailable`. It has no separate Rust `Result` status channel.

# ABI notes

- Canonical Rust path: `slatec_sys::special::airy::dbi`
- Original SLATEC routine: `DBI`
- Native symbol: `dbi_`
- ABI fingerprint: `unavailable`
- Exact Netlib source file: [DBI](https://www.netlib.org/slatec/fnlib/dbi.f)

# Safety

Every raw pointer must be non-null unless this argument contract expressly permits null, correctly aligned, and valid for its documented readable or writable extent. Preserve Fortran column-major layout, length, leading-dimension, workspace, callback-lifetime, aliasing, and provider-runtime requirements. The native routine does not retain ordinary argument pointers beyond this call.
